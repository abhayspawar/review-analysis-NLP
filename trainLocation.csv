(about 1/2 block south of the hotel) for a very inexpensive breakfast a couple of days. one day we walked a few blocks to a nearby coffee shop (no, not starbucks...we avoided corporate coffee), cafe ladro. very good coffee and pastries and worth the 6 or 7 blocks to walk.dinners were mostly eaten in and around the market area. we can highly recommend shiro sushi (again, within easy walking distance) and it was highly recommended to us by one of the front desk staff. (just a tip: ivar's is so overrated don't waste your time. we live in the midwest and we've had fish here that was so much better than that long john silver's knockoff.)the market area itself is a zoo. if you don't like walking into people/crowds in general, you'll go nuts here after a couple of days. granted, we were there over a holiday weekend and during the last day of bumbershoot but even after that ended, it was still nuts. it really wasn't the crowds that got to us so much as the buskers (annoying with a capital a and basically everywhere you turn) and the seemingly endless supply of insane people. that was our biggest takeaway from seattle: is every third person on the street insane? not that we ever felt threatened, quite the contrary. but we had people just randomly yell at us (and everyone else around them), hiss at us like a cat, skateboard by us singing a song about chairman mao...it seemed to never end. i guess you can call it free street theatre.the inn is in the midst of all this and we were definitely at the heart of all the action. the bell staff was incredibly friendly, the front-desk staff was helpful, the room was very nice, the location was tourism ground zero. not really sure how we could have improved on the experience. (oh and it was sunny and 68 every day we were there! so much for the seattle drizzle experience!) honestly if i had one complaint it would be the tv channel selection. there are about 20 channels, half of which are sports, the other half local government and news. boring, boring, boring. but again, we don't go on vacation to watch tv. but if you're looking for something interesting to watch as you fall asleep...good luck to you my friend.if we were going back to seattle and wanted to stay in the city itself, i wouldn't hesitate to go back to inn at the market.

(both john and jessica at dollar were extremely nice too!).this arrangement allowed us to travel down to family in gig harbor and then use the car to return to the airport the next day. justin also informed us that we would most likely have to change rooms on the last night of our 3 night stay, due to a snafu with our hotel.com reservation. once at the ace, we were warmly welcomed by jibriil who showed us our room on the lower level. i was a bit surprised as hotels.com had guaranteed a king size bed and we had a double. i asked jabriil about the mixup (never having booked through hotels.com before) and he explained that there must have been an overlap in the booking. the room and bed were comfortable and a decent size with a large clean bathroom. i'm not that high maintenance, but do like to read at night, but there was no reading lamp in the room, just overhead recessed lighting. jabriil came to my rescue with a small reading lamp and extra pillows. all were clean-pillows obviously sprayed with lysol between uses-but no biggie. the only thing missing in that room was a place to hang clothes and a couple more hangers. on the last night we did indeed have to move to a smaller room. same size bed, smaller bathroom-a bit noisier as it was next to the stairwell. still, we were quite comfortable and slept well. so the plusses: justin and jibriil-definitely they are the nicest guys, unpretentious , friendly, helpful. the location in belltown is in the heart of all the under 30 hipness, but we over 30's , un-inked, non-smokers did not feel too out of place! the minuses: booking through hotels.com (i'm not sure the price of the rooms through them were the same as if we had booked directly through the hotel) and having to switch rooms. we would stay here again, but next time book directly through the hotel and request the rooms with larger beds. still, it truly is the people who make the difference. kudos to the staff at the ace!

(they did do that.) my second room was a little cleaner, but still not up to normal standards for a moderately priced hotel. (and this place isn't moderately priced.) i had to be moved to a third room due to the second room not being a 2-queen room (i had husband and kids arriving). the third room had only one working electrical outlet and that was in the bathroom. again, no counter space. broken shelf. hairs in my clean towel (yuck). the noise was awful; doors banging everywhere; you can hear the toilets and showers and conversations from the next rooms. there is one ice machine  it is on the 7th floor. no kidding. the elevators are incredibly slow-- there are only 2 of them and they are also tiny. you have to go up or down stairs to get to them from the hotel entrance. the hotel had told me i could have a late checkout, due to the hour that my class went to. by random chance, i double checked this on my last day since that i was still down for late checkout  was told i couldn't have that late checkout or i'd be charged another night. i asked when they were planning to tell me that-- when i got back late and they had already charged me??!! no response-- and this was from a manager!! he also tried to tell me i hadn't packed my bags up to have the bellhop move me from room #2 to room #3 -- which was a total lie. he stood there and actually implied that i was lying to him. i was furious and told him that it was the worst hotel i had ever, ever stayed in, and he just stood there smirking and nodding. he never made any attempt to remedy anything, nor to apologize. i was there with six other coworkers and they had similarly bad experiences with the noise and dirt. there is no hotel food service. even if it costs you a little more, stay somewhere else!!! motel 6s are nicer than this place.

""]","not many complaints - overall good hotel! bear with me - long review... but detailed for those who care!!!to start off, we looked for a hotel in downtown seattle for we were going to the international district (chinatown) for four days. my main preference was to have an indoor pool (who knows what the weather will do, so you can't go wrong with that,) and our budget was under $125/night. we got a deal of $100/night at hotels.com and they indeed had an indoor pool. i've had interesting experiences renting hotels from just seeing websites, and this one was one of those times. the parking is bizarre - not only does mapquest or randmcnally.com tell you they can't find it on the map, but if you find it yourself while driving around you only have 2 ways to enter the lot... if you overshoot the entrance then you end up on the frickin' highway. moving on... check-in was crazy... a ton of people were having problems checking in (from online reservations of all things) and surprisingly when it was our turn they found our reservation easy and got us a parking permit and 2 keys without a problem. however, we booked a king and got to the room and it was 2 doubles, and 1 key didn't work. bleh... i was tired and my husband and i just took advantage of more space and slept on the separate beds instead of stand in line to complain about that error. bathroom was good, carpet was ok - not the horrible conditions i expected when reading everyone else's reviews. thought maybe i'd have a view from the window, but all i got was a lovely view of the travelodge right behind us (teeny tiny view of the space needle if you look at the right angle.) definitely within walking distance to the space needle and only a few blocks to restaurants, the malls/stores downtown, and only a few (drivable) neighborhoods away from the international district. the pool's location isn't that great - right behind the hotel lobby (so much for privacy.) but the pool is really clean, and the adjacent hot tub was nice - could easily fit 8 (10 kids probably.) we opted for dim sum downtown every morning, but the one morning i decided to check out the breakfast i saw a pretty decent spread - lots of fresh bagels, huge fresh muffins, a juice machine, coffee, yoplait yogurt cups, and i saw them putting away eggs and turning off the waffle machine - and that's a lot of good food in my opinion. overall, i'd give it an 8 out of 10 - only an 8 because they did screw up the room and the parking sucked - if there were no vacancies then there wouldn't be enough spots - good luck on the street. the holiday inn express across the street had the same parking issues, and the travelodge behind us looked 4x more run down than where we stayed. but for the money and the indoor pool and the breakfast and location, i really don't have any major complaints.

(actually, i think the mattress at the best western over by seattle center was better the one time i stayed there.)the trains. we were in a city-view room, as it was a priceline reservation. we were offered an upgrade to water view for $50 / night, but didn't take it as we weren't tourists  didn't need the view -- i didn't think about the train tracks, though. combined with the rock hard mattress, the trains squealing by all night make it pretty difficult to sleep. avoid city-view rooms.the keys. they demagnetize at the drop of a hat, which led to awkward moments where neither my husband or i could get into the room. the desk staff said it happens all the time if you put the key near credit cards or cell phones. okay, well, where are you going to carry the key if not in a purse or wallet, both of which appear to be landmines of key demagnetization? management clearly knows about it; why is it not fixed? no other hotels have this problem.the size of the rooms. teeny, as already mentioned here. we only just had space to walk between the queen-sized bed and the chair. the little things (also quite mixed):the nickel-and-dime routine. if a cafe two blocks away gives me free wireless with my $2 coffee, why can't the edgewater give its customers free wireless with their $100+ room? if i can park on the street for free right outside the hotel, why charge $28/night for parking? (not to mention i think $28/night is the most expensive hotel parking i've ever seen in seattle.)weird layout. for some patrons, the long walk may be difficult. the lobby isn't in the middle of the hotel, like in most places -- you check in and then all the rooms are down a long, long, narrow hallway. the elevator is halfway down that hallway, not near the lobby. so it could be difficult for elderly or handicapped patrons to navigate.the number of people. because it's on the water it's an event hotel. you'll see a lot of people in the narrow hallways and and in the lounge / lobby. we didn't have much problem with noise in the hallways up on the fourth floor, though, fortunately.no name toiletries. the sort you'd expect in a mid-level chain, not a place trying to be upscale. also, a very strong, not very pleasant scent to them. they were supposedly from a spa in the noble house chain (basically the same as generic holiday inn toiletries). it didn't exactly make me feel i was in a hotel worth $300 a night (good thing i didn't pay that).the fireplace. nice idea, but ours didn't work. it had a pilot light on all night, but no matter what we did with the thermostat the fireplace wouldn't light. we tried the timer as well and that also didn't work. trying to sleep across from the pilot light, combined with the train noise and the hard mattress, was difficult.the curtains. two choices -- completely shut and blocking all light, or completely open and flashing the street as you dress. i like having some light in the room during the day, even while i'm getting up  getting ready, so a set of sheers behind the heavy curtains would have been nice, and you usually see that in hotels, but the edgewater just had one set of heavy curtains. many of these are not big things, but small touches that, when neglected, show that the edgewater isn't an upscale hotel worth the money they charge. if you can book a water-view room for under $100 on priceline, it's worth it. if not, it's not.

(this information was provided by their very helpful and pleasant client services manager.) however, there was no card advertising this point, it was not (as far as i can recall) in the service guide, and no one told me at the front desk. this minor point bugged me as, being a brit, i find i get very antsy when i can't make tea.not-too-pleasant scent of old buildings in the bathroom, which was also cold and drafty and did not have it's own heat. very pretty though and well equipped. lovely bath robes. location not central. while the hotel operates a town car we had out own wheels and drove into seattle's city centre. we think we prefer to walk out into the thick of things. the hotel is in a residential area. this said, that is just out personal preference.we would definitely recommend the hotel to friends, but we would mention the cold bathroom and to ask for a coffee press. it is for these two reasons that i have rated our stay a 4 and not a 5.

']","good overall but not 5 star this hotel is in a great location....walking distance to shopping, restaurants and attractions. so if you are looking for a perfect location you cannot go wrong. the room was clean, the bathroom large with lots of counter space, towels and ammenities. i was in the north tower on an upper floor with a spectacular view of the space needle and puget sound! the service express was great, anything i called about was taken care of in a prompt courteous manner. in fact, room service would be at my door 10 minutes after i called and bell man almost immediately. the concierge was helpful and knowledgeable about the area. the food is fairly limited and is also very expensive. all hotel food is expensive but i thought this was more so than other hotels and i travel extensively. just oatmeal and tea in the morning for one cost almost $25 once service charge etc is factored in. a better option would be to go to the 5th ave cafe which is located in the downstairs lobby. the same breakfast would cost less than $10. the cafe has everything, not just a la carte, you can get waffles, pancakes, hot sandwhiches and soup for lunch.i did use the gym and liked it a great deal. the only hotel i have stayed in with a better one was an orlando hotel which had a unique facility to rival most gyms. they have several treadmills and elyptical machines, stair climbers with their invidual tvs and headphones which is nice. they had a few upper and lower body machines and free weights. they also had a smaller room with a couple machines and equipment such as a stability ball. i was at a conference so we gathered in the bar in the lobby several times, the services there is great the waitress melody was very friendly. a relaxing atmosphere and wireless access throughout.the bad: internet access beware of this. ok, the hotel does not have wireless access in your room. if your pc detects a wireless network it is not the hotel's network. it is a separate network which will charge $10 a day to your credit card and not your room bill. to connect to the westin's network you need to plug in the network cable. you will see the westin logo etc and that the charge is billed to your room. they do not tell you this. the conference i attended covered room charges, so i ended up paying out of pocket for a day's worth of internet access which was not credited to me. they were like oh well it is not our network and we have no control over this also the network was saturated and for 2 days i could not get access to the westin's network and if i did it was extremely slow.one other thing: i had a connecting room and a door divided my room with the room next door. i did not know the men next door. the door was not sound proofed and i could hear every conversation they had and i am sure they could hear me as well. these people were in and out all hours of the day and night. also i was across from a stairwell which is used by service people. so all night i would hear this door slamming shut. i hardly got any sleep despite the nice comfy beds with all this racket. then on my last night about 1am, the group of men staying in the room next door tried to bust open the door between our rooms and get into my room! i was shaken up by this and as my room was at the end of the hall had no way out. and i am a woman traveling alone. i called the desk and they sent security up right away. the mgr also phoned me back and changed my room to a different floor in a non-connecting room. this room was quiet. ironically my last night was the only night i had 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep without doors slamming. so overall it was a fairly good stay but as i did not feel safe due to the incident above i was happy to be checking out.

were looking for a cheap hotel that was close to downtown attractions.i will start with the review of the area since that has come into question in a couple other reviews. the hotel was in an older area of the city most likely built for the 1962 worldHuo Chu  fair. as a result of this there were a few homeless people and possibly drug dealers in the area. it should be mentioned though that these people never bothered us and we walked around the area/city a lot. often times we walked to dinner and other attractions. i felt safe walking both day and night but i was very aware of my surroundings, keeping an eye out for any possible problems. the location was nice in that it was about a 3 blk walk to the seattle center (space needle area) and from there you could take the monorail into downtown or if you wanted to walk a little further towards downtown you could get on one of the free buses from 6am to 7pm. we did have a rental car which we took at times to go to see the boeing tour and mt. rainier among other places. the free parking at the hotel was a great benefit as we saw the parking lots in the area charged between $10  $20/day.now onto the hotel itself. it is still going through major upgrades. during our stay the put up new lights in the lobby and hallways. they also put new electronic locks on the doors. due to this upgrade the hallways were not the cleanest at all times (sheetrock and other debris) but this did not affect our room. there is a pool and hot tub which we did not use. i did see a couple of people using the hot tub and it appeared to be nice. i did check one night and the water was very warm so that is a plus. the breakfast area is a room they converted into the breakfast area. the room looks very nice and overall breakfast was pretty good. they had sausage patties and egg patties (similar to what you would get at mcdonalds but tasted a little better). they also had cold cereal, bread for toast, bagels, and a small selection of pastries which could have been better. one of the nice things is they had waffle makers. also, they had a good selection of coffee and four different kinds of juices.finally, the room was what i expected it to be. it wasnHuo Zhua  large but big enough to fit a king size bed and still have plenty of room to walk around. it had an approximately 21Huo ?tv with a large selection of channels. it

(a quick note about staff, they seem to be uniformly amazingly young. this means that you should not expect a great breadth of experience in the hospitality industry.) guests observed in the lobby area seemed mostly the t-shirt, grungy blue jean, running shoe crowd. this seemed a bit odd giving that the w is not really a cheap place to stay. one of the most striking aspects of the seattle w is its decor and darkness. lighting in the halls, elevators and other public spaces without windows is incredibly low and techno. for instance, one needs to be quite close (within a foot or two) of a room door to discern the room number. my wife called the decor urban zen and i think this is probably as good as any moniker.our room was extremely nice and spacious. and yes, the cd was playing at an appropriate volume when we walked in. the bed was extremely comfortable. the room had very large windows with peek-a-boo views of puget sound. a full size chaise was along one wall next to a very nicely equipped desk. the bath was large and had more towels than anyone could use. the faucet handle on the tub/shower was close to breaking so controlling water temperature and pressure was quite difficult. when our car and driver arrived to take us to our evening activities we again were reminded of the extremely poor layout of access to the hotel. the combination of arriving and departing guests, aggressive taxi drivers whipping about and traffic wizzing by make entering and exiting more than an adventure.the earth and ocean restaurant on-site again is very much on the trendy side. we found the staff extremely warm, friendly and professional. the menu selection could only be characterized as super-trendy. fortunately, the w is in the heart of downtown so there are dozens of super dining options for those not in an adventurous culinary mood. one minor annoyance is that i still don't have a breakdown of what this little adventure cost. apparently, the w billing system is not capable of providing an up-to-date itemization of charges upon check-out.

the w hotel stay was for any friday or saturday night. at first i thought it was a mix-up by the charity, and frankly, it was for charity and i didn't really care. but after my experience with the arrogant, sloppy and just horrifically bad service at the w, i now wonder if the mistake was theirs.when i realized the room and tickets were incompatible, i decided to use the room as a surprise for the bf. i procured theatre tickets to a sold out show, and called the w to make a reservation. after being on hold for at least 10 minutes while the operator tried to figure it out, i was sent to the 800 number. the 800 operator was not exactly rude, but disinterested, uninformed, and generally oozed negative attitude. she, too, couldn't figure it out, and it literally took over 1/2 hour to make the reservation.when i made the reservation, i also told the operator that i wanted a corner room with a view and would pay whatever it took to upgrade to it. she assured me that i would have a corner room on a high floor with a view, and even after i offered three times to pay for an upgrade, she told me (coldly and condescendingly (difficult to articulate)) that it would not be necessary and that i would get my request.you can see where this is going. when we arrived for check in, they gave us a corner room on the 5th floor in the back of the building, facing the wall of the four season's garage across an alley. when i spoke to the disinterested i'm too cool for my job desk clerk, the best i could get was a regular room on a somewhat higher floor, also in the back of the building, this time overlooking the same garage by about 10 feet. no apology, no real help, and attitude. by the way -- when i presented the 'bearer certificate' that i discussed with the reservation department for over 30 minutes earlier in the day, mr. hip had no idea what to do, called over an apparently more experienced version of himself, and the two of them took 20 minutes to, you guessed it, figure it out.trying to keep a positive outlook, the bf and i decided to go to earth and ocean, the hotel restaurant. it was a busy saturday night. we stood in a highly trafficked area and were ignored until i was able to stop the greeter, who told me they were no longer serving in the dining room, but we could order from a bar menu at the bar. then he walked away. i mean, literally -- just walked away without additional comment, leaving us to figure out if we should seat ourselves, wait for someone else, or move into the lounge area. after a moment, we were able to stop another staff member who handed us two sticky bar menus while we were still standing in that odd, highly trafficked area, and i swear -- he, too, just walked away without comment. we left and went to a bistro down the street.the room was okay, albeit dark and facing the roof deck of the garage across the alley; the bathroom was dirty and well below five star standards.we left the next morning, and the portfolio read zero balance. while i was very disappointed with the attitude and service of the staff from beginning to end, thought the room was substandard, and had paid several hundred dollars for a package that was not a package, i thought i'd just let it go and remember that at least the charity made out well.then, of course, i get my credit card bill. yep, you guessed it. they charged me for the privilege of being ignored, condescended to, spending (between the two operators) over forty-five minutes to even make a reservation, and placing me in a substandard room with a dirty bathroom. i called them to correct the latest mistake in a series of mistakes, and after explaining the situation to someone in their reservation department, was forwarded to the guest services manager. i can't articulate the attitude well at all -- but at least it's consistent. disinterested and arrogant is the best way to describe it. he told me that he would look into it, and call me back. two days later i got a voicemail from him asking for the charity i purchased the room from, because he couldn't find the certificate. at this point, i was furious and didn't immediately return the call. about an hour later, he called again and told me he found the certificate and would be refunding the $230.00 charge to my card. the entire conversation took less than 30 seconds, and ended with a curt, perfunctory and insincere apology. period.wow... just unbelievable. i don't see why anyone would want to stay here. the rooms are average at best, the bathroom was dirty, and the service was just too hip and arrogant to be anything but worthless. the location is good, poised strategically between the financial and retail districts downtown, but so are several other very fine hotels. if you come to seattle, stay in the area, but don't stay at this facility. i can't imagine anyplace that would reflect more poorly on our city.

(his reaction was so normal as if it was just another same complain)still, the same problem for the other room but the condition seems better, just a little fur ball + few hair.......... also, when we took our shower at night, we had to do it quick because there was not enough hot water for 4 of us. it costed me almost us280/2 nights. at first, i thought it was a decent, chic and hip boutique hotel, but in fact, i was cheated by the beatifully designed website. this is just a nightmare for me and my children!!! i would never stayed at this hotel again.

(this allows for easy wheelchair access.) when you run the shower, the water goes under the curtain and all over the floor. it even leaked into the room. after two days, i learned to roll up damp towels and create a dam around the shower. also, the towel bar was sagging and about to fall out. in addition, housekeeping had a hard time remembering to restock soaps (two times) robes (several times) and other small housekeeping items in the room. although the staff politely took care of things, it seemed that i had at address one or two similar issues almost daily. the exhaust fan was noisy - not befitting a hotel of this price and star rating. some issues took repeated requests.the temperature control in the room is a simple window air unit. this unit is very noisy - again, not befitting a hotel of this price and star rating. when it rains, the rain and the roof runoff pounds down on the metal housing. as a result, you get the sound of water torture all night. i wound up opening a window (on the 9th floor) and straddling the windowsill in order to throw a hand towel on the top of the air conditioner. this got rid of the noise and almost got me killed. (ha!)the worst thing was that the wake up service was not working. i did set the alarm as a back up but it is very complicated and it didnHuo Zhua  go off. as a result, i missed my meeting. advice Huo ?bring your own clock. i addressed with the manager on duty who promised to take care of it, but i donHuo Zhua  recall an explanation or an apology or even notification if the problem was fixed or not. i took my chances a couple of days later and it worked. the busniess center: when i was there, the business center was sometimes used by children who needed extensive myspace fixes and im sessions. the front desk: the desk clerks were great. they were quick with conversation and a smile. they were always courteous and helpful. hotels like this have staff that reek of attitude, but the staff at the max was very welcoming and approachable.breakfast: the attached restaurant is a popular place. the asian restaurant offers breakfast as well, but the offerings are basic breakfast food at (eggs and hash browns) with foo-foo names at very high prices. breads and pastries were greasy and were comparable to items from a filling station. the fruit promised on the menu was simply aged, brown garnish left over from the night before. the coffee, however, was fantastic and kept me coming there for breakfast several times. i am a glutton for punishment. if you are not a coffee lover, avoid this place at all costs for breakfast. final verdict: after stripping away the pretty faMang ade, and the friendly service, you have a minimum service hotel. this could compare to the motels down the block (*6th avenue inn, 8th avenue inn, travelodge) at half the price. this place is simply a place to sleep and very much worth the standard 89-109 dollars charged at properties of similar services or quality. we paid over $150 a night and after considering the ups and downs of this place, we felt a bit violated by that high price. if you must stay here, try to find a better rate online or try to negotiate with the reservations agent.conclusion: all in all, it was an ok stay. it was a safe and clean place to stay and we did appreciate feeling welcomed as a same-gender couple. however, now that i know the city better, there are places with the same level of service and comfort at much lower prices. despite the welcoming staff and the cool dMao cor, there would have to be a serious upgrade in service, cut in price and/or improvement in the rooms before i would consider the max again.stayed: march 19-25, room 914 ",2.0

(kills me when people go to nyc or some similiar place and complain about the street noise!)the room gets 'a' grade!the following morning, we were assured that our request for a smoke free room was being handled, so we packed our bags and checked them at the front desk before heading out for the day. the hotel is in a good location, very close to pacific place mall, just a couple of blocks from the monorail to the space needle and a straight shot down stewart to the public market. it's crucial to note that there is a starbucks to your right -- and left, as you exit the hotel. my co-worker and i love to walk, so had no problems getting around to all of the sights. the max is also located just a few blocks from the free ride zone that allows you to travel on the city bus for free to the key downtown areas. location gets an 'a' (although some may feel it's just a hair out of the way. we did experience a couple of hiccups when trying to switch rooms, but the staff was very patient and dilligent in making sure we were taken care of... they even offered us a bottle of wine!staff gets an 'a' as well.the adjoining restaurant is a great spot for drinks... we loved the atmosphere, but did not have dinner. overall-- i give this hotel great praise and would definitely reccommend it. it's on the funky side, so if you're more of a comfort inn kind of person, you may feel a little more at home elsewhere. i'm sure i'll return to seattle again -- and hope to visit the max on my return!

(for those of you who know seatac hotels, this is the old red lion. need i say more?)priceline gave me an excellent rate of $52, but true to the adage of 'getting what you pay for' a lower-paying guest gets the leavings, and the front desk immediately placed me in a distant lower wing. as i walked the quarter mile through glass skybridges, up elevators, down elevators, through the convoluted maze, i had a strong sense of dMao jBiao  vu... and it was true, i had stayed there before. the wings of this hotel were an afterthought; the 14-story tower building was a huge success, and of course greed made the owners try to expand on something good and ruined a wonderful hotel by adding the wings. to get to them is an alpine trek, dragging luggage down a hall, up an elevator, through the skybridge, down an elevator, up an elevator to the next, etc. on and on. you can drive to them and park outside, so for a family i suppose you could build a case for them. however the big problem is that the rooms in the wings are universally equipped with air conditioning and heating units apparently once the prototype of a jt8d pratt and whitney turbojet engine. low, medium and high fan speeds are exactly the same, a roar that earplugs can't begin to silence. after two rooms i complained so loudly at the desk that the woman staffer upgraded me to the tower, and gave me a $15 discount voucher which i used quite happily on room service. ironically the tower is older but much nicer than the wings.the rooms have been extensively refurbished and have silent air conditioning and comfortable beds. when i went to the ice machine and filled my bucket there was a black spot in the ice, and when i dug through it i found a swollen and frozen dead housefly. i'm glad i didn't fill my glass to make a cold drink, but that has to be a rare thing and i'm not holding it against the doubletree... a fly in the middle of winter in seattle? hmm, maybe it was there since last summer and finally worked it's way to the... oh let's just drop it!about the dMao jBiao  vu, and to risk beating a dead horse, i had stayed there years ago when it was the red lion, had the exact same experience, and vowed never to stay there again. little did i know that doubletree had taken it over, and was not the old doubletree. (you can't win!) they have such a good reputation but to take on properties like this erodes my faith in their name... that time i was there for two weeks and i was stupid enough to put up with the turbine pit for several sleep-deprived days before complaining my way into the tower! lol!it's a huge hotel, reminiscent of a las vegas resort. nice pool, steamy-hot outdoor spa, though the guests coming in through the extensive and far reaching skyway were all shivering and teeth chattering in the near-freezing air. probably a better amenity in the warmer months. they have an outstanding exercise facility, and as far as food the pan-fried hazelnut crusted halibut on fettuccine made it all the way to my room in great condition for a dine-in meal that was excellent. all in all, doubletree has done its best to run this pathetic property, but you you can't teach a pig to sing and you can't make a poorly thought out property work to their standards without major structutural changes by the owners. dollar for dollar it pales in comparison to the nearby hilton, which i had just stayed at for $50 priceline dollars and loved it.

look for the large doubletree bus. there is another downtown doubletree shuttle so make sure you are on the correct shuttle! only a short 8 minute ride put us at the hotel check in for a signature warm cookie and friendly service. i was originally assigned a ground room floor in a remote building but requested a 3rd floor/top floor room instead, preferably overlooking the onsite pond. without a blink from the desk clerk, i got my third floor...only later did i understand it was in the tall tower staring at scaffolding that was part of the exterior stucco project occuring this april and may. i had a view of two busy streets, a parking lot and the large northwest airlines maintenance hangar each morning. despite not being informed of this construction on checkin or during my reservation, the workers were of no consequence and i never heard them. i just had to keep a south window curtain pulled since the scaffolding was right....there. i was here for an intense work session anyhow and it wasn't noisy beyond what i expected for an airport hotel so i bit the bullet and kept the room. i'll get the 3rd floor pond view on another visit. i'm sure i could've pushed but just needed to get settled and get busy.the building layout here is rather adventurous so take care to consider how far you want to be from certain features and/or activities. if you do want a view, the upper floors of the tower offer westward views across seatac and the elliot bay area. despite the ages of the buildings, the lower structures all have a very contemporary northwest feeling to them with exposed beams and rich details throughout the complex. i found this to be very welcoming and comfortable. keep in mind the views are limited if any from this complex.the tower room had a corner wrap around deck but no exterior chairs to enjoy the crisp humid air. i did have a chair out for a few evening hours to enjoy the air. since the deck above partially covered mine, it was like a room extension and the wraparound deck was enormous. without scaffolding and workers there i'm sure it is downright enjoyable.the room itself was large with a mixture of maple and cherry woods with contemporary shapes and accents. upon entering the room, to the left is a full sink and closet, with the bath, toilet and another full sink further left and separated by a door. they have the nice touch of a full length mirror on this door, whcih seems to be a rarity for hotels i been in recently. the closet was generous and had plenty of hangars, an iron and ironing board. a few steps further into the room and it oepned up to the bed, a long couch, end table, coffee table, occassional chair, a full size desk and even an adjustable task chair for the desk area. the king size bed was comfortable and had 6 comfortable feather pillows. the bedside table had a phone along with the standard hilton multi-function alarm clock. doubletree offers a wolfgang puck branded coffee and tea with a special maker for you to use (but you'll have to unplug your computer to do it). the adjacent desk area was comfortable and easy to work on. my only complaint was the single outlet space on the desk shared by the coffee maker. if you have more than three items to charge or want coffee, you'll have to go looking high and low.hvac was electronically controlled and was easily and quickly adjusted. it was a return air system and was only a low hum. ther return air register above the stand alone sink was furrier than a pet shop and definately needed a good vacuum and wipe down.each room is equipped with pay by the day or pay by the hour ethernet internet and i had no problems connecting for service. if you want to save the time or only need it for a short period, the lobby area has reliable wifi for free. i only hooked up one day of my stay and the others i used the lobby wifi for data transfers. using a webservice you can print directly to the front desk and it will be delivered or you can pick it up. this was a huge time saver and no charge for the service. it works from both the pay accounts and the free wifi.decor was toward the tans, oranges, and browns in the room, and that kept a nice feeling depite the typical semi sunny and rainy weather during the stay. the room carpet was well kept with only a few stains near the coffee maker. the bathroom was roomy and clean. i still find it hard to overlook the extensive grout mold that seems to crop up at all price points only because it is not a hard fix, it just takes someone using the right material in a proper install. the complimentary nutragena bath condiments were welcome as i like that they are non-allergenic and don't leave a scent of any sort. the best part of the bathroom was the lack of noise from any other resident or function around you. the room was overall a fairly quiet place but keep in mind you are across from a busy airport and a stones throw from one of the bsuiest intersections in the region. you will hear noise and some of it will be loud enough to notice.the features of the hotel are pretty good. the lobby restaurant is pretty good for all meals and the bar/grill could use better service but didn't get so bad as to not be able to recommend it. there is a little coffee and danish spot as well as a full service sundries shop, just be ready to pay airport prices for your purchases. the bright spots are the well appointed health clubs that serve the tower and complex. among the nicest i've seen in the past few years.the tower room looking west was too low to see anything but high enough not to be insulated from the road and airport noise. i'd go as as high up as possible in the tower to have the view or as far to the northeast as possible to get a room on the pond and some quiet. everything in between will still have something in proximity - you'd do well to look at the hotel layout and talk it over with the reservation or desk clerk to get the room you really want. ill be back, but on that 3rd or 4th floor overlooking the pond next time.

the other room we had been assigned was missing that and the lampshades by the bed side - no lampshades!! besides that, even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room, it truly smelled of smoke in there. then i noticed that the a/c wasn't kicking in even though i was lowering the thermostat into the 50's. called the front desk and explained the situation and that i wasn't happy with the rooms i had been assigned. the person at the front desk was quick in re-assigning us to different rooms at which point we had to pack up our bags and go back all the way to the front desk to pick up the new keys. the second rooms were better, they were cooler and the heavy sun-blocking curtain was there. why these rooms had them and not the others, i don't understand! headed out to take in some sights and we were back at our rooms by 9:30 pm. the a/c system was not cooling the rooms at that point. i was about to call the front desk when the fire alarm went off. grabbed the most important items and joined the rest of the guests in exiting the building. a staff person from the front desk was going around asking guests to return to their rooms and that it had been a false fire alarm. i decided to go to the front desk to complain about the malfunctioning a/c. i can only describe the scene as chaos when i got there. there were many guests just screaming and complaining about the whole situation. there was this lady who had mentioned the alarm had gone off two nights before. another gentleman was demanding to be moved to a different red lion. the front desk was getting calls from the rooms complaining about how warm it was and all they were suggesting was for the guests to open the windows to let some of the cool air in. the poor guy at the front desk looked like he was going to lose it any minute and appeared to be on the verge of tears. i finally made my way to the front desk and asked what was going on with the a/c. he said he just did not know. well, how was he going to handle the situation. he explained that all he could do was call an a/c maintenance guy to look into the situation. i explained i just could not and would not stay at a place without any a/c. he ended up not charging for the rooms for the night and i started to search the internet for another hotel to move to for the rest of my stay. it was a night of tossing and turning because of the warmth. i think at most i got 3 hours of itermittent sleep that night and was just exhausted in the morning. i just could not wait to leave in the morning. red lion hotels are supposed to be at least three stars but this one, because of the state that it is in, i can not even classify it as a motel. if you are considering a stay here, do not do so until you confirm that renovations have been completed. shame on the new owner for not closing the place and completing renovations before opening up for business. i guess the negative reviews will continue on this one throughout the summer season.there might have been some things that i wold have been willing to overlook but the last straw were the problems with the cooling and what seemed might be regular false fire alarms. i can not comment on the breakfast, i did not partake since i just wanted out of there - fast!!

']","travel agent perspective i am a travel agent and my daughter and i stayed at the colony bay the week of april 17th for one week. we had a very good holiday at this resort but there certainly were pluses and minuses. this resort has only been open for three months, so it has a long way to go to receive a 5 star rating, i would rate it at a 3.5. i think part of the problem is the expectation of the guests that it is sold as a 5 star by sunquest and they have paid for a 5 star when it is only a 3.5. with that out of the way, you will not be disappointed if you expect a 3.5 star and pay for a 3.5 star. this resort is located in uvero alto and not in bavaro and so the bus ride from the airport is one hour to this resort. it is in an isolated location located one property over from the dreams resort (previously sunscape the beach). if you wish to leave the resort to go into bavaro or higuey, the taxi cab prices are very expensive ie: to reach the majestic colonial in bavaro from the colony bay is $33.00 us one way, $60.00 us to the punta cana airport one way, needless to say, we didn't leave the resort and for this reason we felt claustrobphobic. pool and beach area:it is a small resort located directly on the beach and it only took you a minute to get to your room, the restaurants, the lobby, the pool, the beach and had ramps for wheelchair accessibility, (although the ramps were a little steep). my recommendation to the resort is that they install a hand rail into the pool, as the steps are hard to see and 3 people fell down going into the pool, one guest actually broke her arm and dislocated her shoulder. the pool is large and cleaned daily (i was out there at 6:30 a.m. every morning). there are plenty of palapas and lounge chairs as well as on the beach. there was no poolside waiter service but the swim up bar was very close to all sides of the pool. the beach itself was beautiful, and yes it has very light fine brown sand and there are waves at this beach which made it great for boogie boarding, but it is not the calm waters clear waters of the caribbean, but remember, you are on the atlantic ocean side of the island not the caribbean sea side. i do not recommend this beach for young children as there is a strong undertow and it was red flagged 4 days out of 7 while we were there. there are no non-motorized water sports to speak of, the boogie boards were broken and not replaced, they did have kayaks, but the waves are too rough for kayaking, there was no parasailing, jet skis, banana boats etc., you had to go down the beach to the dreams resort for these motorized water sport activities. the plus of this beach is that there are not thousands of people on it like bavaro, so if you want a nice secluded beach to walk, this certainly is for you. there was relatively very little seaweed on the beach but if you walked down to the dreams, they had so much seaweed on the beach that the smell was not pleasant. they do have a kids club area but i didn't see anything going on there. they do have a disco in the sports bar until they finish building the casino and disco. music was extremely loud but the break dancers were unbelievable! they closed the sports bar for three days and the dancing moved into the lobby bar area and it was much better as everyone participated in dancing from the young to seniors and they had brought in a singer and piano player, which everyone enjoyed.rooms:the rooms are basic, no coffee makers in the room, but i brought my own. the remote for the tv didn't work, but got that fixed the next day. the beds were fine but very small pillows. pressure in the shower was great, but just had warm water, never got hot. the safe is free but make sure to ask for the lock at check in. mini bar was stocked every day with 2 cervasas, 2 bottled water and 2 cokes. there were snacks, chocolate bars etc in the fridge but there was a charge for them, they have price tags on them, very expensive, bring your own. i saw a fellow at the front desk who was quite irate because he had been charged for a chocolate bar that he never had and the front desk's solution was to give him a chocolate bar but he had to pay for the first one he never had -- only in the dominican! i recommend to the resort that they do not stock these items in the fridge as they don't seem to have a good tracking system of what was used -- and so there were arguments over guests being charged and not having used the item and of course, there is no way to prove anything. if you want a snack just go to the gift shop, the prices were cheaper anyway. maid service was good, no complaints there. workmanship at this resort is not very good but again, 3.5 star.front desk check in was no problem and quick and they spoke english pretty good.restaurants and service:i have been to punta cana 7 times before and had stayed at 5 star resorts, and i have to say that the food was pretty good at this resort, there was something to eat for everyone and the best was certainly their desserts - they were fantastic! although, don't expect to see a lot of shrimp, lobster etc. in the buffet. but i have to rate the food at 8 out of 10. i have to rate the service at this resort as a 10 out of 10. the staff were very friendly and courteous -- this was the biggest plus of this resort and luis and pablo, the bartenders were fantastic! entertainment and nightly shows:the entertainment at the pool was basic with water aerobics, dancing lessons, waterpolo, beach volleyball etc. the nightly shows were a little cheesey, except the michael jackson show was pretty good. my complaint is that these shows started way too late at night 9:45 pm, so there wasn't a whole lot to do between supper and waiting for the show to begin. not enough activities at this resort. check out was fast and painless. my complaint is with sunquest that we had to leave the hotel so early for the airport and ended up spending almost 4 hours at the punta cana airport -- this was ridiculous and of course, there was no sunquest rep at the resort the day we were leaving. there were travel agency owners at this resort at the time we were there and they were on the same plane as we were leaving for edmonton at 7:05 p.m. but they didn't leave the resort until 4:00 p.m. (what's up with that when we had to be at the lobby at 2:00 p.m. to leave for the airport). check out is at noon. if you want to stay in your room until 4:00 p.m. if you have a late flight out, you can pay an extra $20.00 us. otherwise, they do have a shower area in the lobby part.my recommendation to my clients is that if you are looking for a small resort, not a lot of walking etc., a quiet time by the pool and beach, good food and good service i would recommend this resort as a sold 3.5 star at this time. if you are looking for a resort with a lot of activities, amenities, children's activities and want to leave the resort to explore the towns and area etc. i do not recommend this resort as it is way out of the way and very expensive to get anywhere. the owner had stated that they will be building an additional 320 rooms but i recommend that they bring the current status of this resort up first before building more rooms and not having all the services and amenities in place for the guests first.we did have a great holiday but my expectations were that of a 3.5 star and not a 5 star.

march 26 to april 2flew out of saskatoon with skyservice early in the morning, with a quick twenty minute stop in regina to pick up some other people. the flight was good, movies were okay and the food was your typical flight food. arrived in punta cana ready for a cold beer, cigarette and to have a great vacation.the airport check in went very smoothly and before we knew it we had found our bus and were on our way, with a nice cold beer in hand. we were the only ones on the sunquest bus going to colony bay, and were dropped off first so this was a bonus, as it was an hours bus ride to the resort and it was pretty hot and muggy on the bus.check in went smoothly as we were the only ones checking in. we were given our key, towel cards and the card to activate our power in the room which includes the air conditioning. we were also made to sign a paper agreeing to pay for anything other than the two pop and two beer, replenished each day in the fridge. we actually ended up having some chips but if you go to the store first thing in the morning on the resort to replace them you can save a few bucks - a bit dishonest but after experiencing the dishonesty throughout the week from others that work there we didnt feel so bad. a little warning as well we ended up having to pay for a chocolate bar on check out which was supposed to be three dollars but they charged us four as they said it was an extra dollar for taxes. unbelievable but we just chalked it up to experience.we were escorted by a bell boy who helped us to our room with our luggage. we were on the third floor in building three. although the rooms are not the largest we have been in, they were clean and suited us just fine. the beds were not queen size but comfortable and big enough for us. the bathroom was fairly large and there was plenty of hangers in the closet and three large drawers in the dresser for anything else we wanted to store in there. the balcony is the smallest i have ever seen but big enough for the two chairs and little table that is out there. we actually sat out there a few evenings relaxing and listening to the music from the entertainment. the pool is sensational and the swim up bar is awesome. we ended up spending the majority of our vacation at the pool and did not mind one bit. there was always lots of room to swim and we never had a problem getting chairs. as far as getting the umbrellas around the pool for the shade, if you cant find one just back up about thirty feet from the pool and there are extras on the sand back there. we only used one once so wasnt a problem. and yes there is sand that blows in the jetted tubs and the pool but it is very windy at this resort and what do you expect when the beach is right there. we were at the pool early enough a few times and watched the staff working very hard to clean the sand out. there never seemed to be any throughout the day so obviously they cleaned it very well in the mornings. also, maybe some people who are walking on the beach should utilize the showers to rinse off prior to going into the pool and this would help as well. the pool to us was awesome and kept very clean for the most part. the swim up bar was fun and plentiful as i found out the first full day there. please say hi to henry (boom boom). we also played water polo a few afternoons and had a blast with this as well. the beach is nice although very windy there is lots of chairs but most people dont tend to sit there i think because of the wind. the sand is nice but definitely not your white powder like other beaches in the dominican. to the left of the resort when you are facing the ocean there is extra lots and yes lots of garbage but they do not belong to the resort so i dont think it is fair to judge the resort for this. as far as the ocean well it is very wavy as previously stated in other reviews. this is because it is open water with no protective barrier of a reef to help break the waves. we did go wave jumping a few times and had a blast but the undertow is very strong so wouldnt let kids go in without supervision that is forsure. i would also make sure that you wear water shoes as although it seems nice and sandy my man stepped on something and ended up having to go to the doctor when we returned for antibiotics and to have over ten large slivers taken out of his foot. so beware of things in the water.the staff is excellent and try very hard to make your vacation good for the most part. however, there are some that dont smile and really dont want to do much without a tip and even then are still not very happy. our maid was good although nothing spectacular and you had to tip to get your extra beer and pop stocked in the fridge. also, not very giving with clean towels and facecloths so you may have to hunt her down for this. the bar staff at both the pool and lobby were excellent as were the restaraunt staff for the most part. the front desk however, really made me mad a few times. there is a problem in building three with the air conditioning freezing up on a daily basis. a little advice, turn it off when you leave in the morning and then back on in the evening and it should work. we found this out and it only takes a few minutes to cool the room off. a few times we called the front desk but really did not get any help. they then just plain wouldnt answer the phone when we called. kind of a pain but it was okay until i watched them one day in the lobby when the phone would ring. they would look at it and determine what room was calling discuss it amongst themselves and then laugh and ignore the phone!! i was not impressed with this at all as i felt it very unfair to people who were calling. so again for the most part staff were good except for the desk people.sunquest rep. marie jose - we were not impressed with this woman at all and will be contacting sunquest to discuss her attitude and the way that she treats some people. she was very blunt and rude at the best of times. we arrived on a wednesday and because we were the only two who arrived she did not come around until a larger group arrived for friday. now normally this would have been fine except the only trip we wanted to go on to saona island was on fridays and wednesdays. the day she came so it was too late to go and the day we were leaving. we were able to go on sunday with a brittish group which turned out to be a blast but she really did not encourage us to go with this group as she did not feel it would be very good. she made it very clear what she thought of the british - not exactly a good thing for a tour rep. however we found out later that this was because she doesnt make commission on this tour because it isnt through sunquest. guess if she had of been to see us on thursday this would have been eliminated. there were other things concerning her as well but i wont get into them, i will let sunquest deal with them.there are also a few people who work around the pool trying to get you to buy horse back riding excursions. we considered this but in the end didnt go. some did and had a great time so i am sure it would be something to see and do. however, when you say no these people will bother you at least three times per day and are a real pain in the butt sometimes. i finally had to get rude as every time i tried to relax by the pool they were there bothering us. the food - i have thought long and hard on how to put this part into my review. let me start with the steakhouse which i will tell you was by far the best meal we had and absolutely delicious. we had rib eye with baked potatoes and not only was it hot but it was delicious. we also had the buffalo wings for an appetizer which were excellent as well - make sure you each order an order though as you only get two to an order. not like here where you get ten or more to an order. the buffet. well the desserts were always excellent and the ice cream was to die for. breakfast was exactly the same each day and the omelettes were okay but usually undercooked. the food was always cold it seemed and basically the same every day for every meal. definitely not the best but not the worst either. never walked away hungry but was not impressed with the food. definitely a 3.5 at the most as far as the food in the buffet is concerned. please watch the chicken as it is usually undercooked. trip to saona was a good day and lots of fun. although not the party on the catermaran that i have endured in the past. but beautiful and fun just the same. lunch was excellent as well and so were the drinks.shopping was okay we ventured to the little shopping market a couple of times and bargained some good deals. although it is definitely not mexico, they have some nice stuff and we were lucky to get some good deals. so overall i am a very experienced traveller and i am usually pretty fair and have fun. we had a good vacation and except for the food really did enjoy ourselves. however, we would not return to this resort and if we didnt get such an awesome deal i would be very upset. however we only paid eight hundred a piece so even though they advertise this place as a four and a half to five, we only paid for a three to three and a half so are happy. but i dont believe the resort will ever be higher than a 3.5 and definitely would never pay full price to go there.now for the worst part of our entire trip and let me tell you i have been to the dr four times and loved it each time - even this time with the resort - until we went to leave. i can now honestly say that i will never return to this country ever again. we checked out and our bus was a bit late but not a big deal. the ride back to airport was okay and although the airport was very busy we were okay with this as well. when we got to the check in we were told our suitcases were over weight and it was going to cost us $200.00 us. we were prepared for this as we were overweight coming from canada as well so not a huge suprise. however, the guy checking us in slipped my passport back across the counter and told me he would give me a deal and would only charge me $150 if i slipped the money in the passport. of course we did this and he pocketed the cash. i will be honest we only put $75 in the passport - i guess two can play the game is what we thought. we then proceeded to check in and went through security with no problems. we ate at wendys and shopped a little at duty free before boarding the plane which was on time. however then it all went bad. everyone was on the plane and they were about to close the door when a security lady from there got on and started down the isle. she got to our seats and asked to see our tickets and passports. she then told me that i needed to come with her. now let me tell you this scared me but as the plane was ready to leave. i tried to ask her on the way back in the airport what the problem was but she wouldnt answer me. i thought forsure the plane was going to leave me behind. anyways she took me into the security room where a security guard who could not speak english was going through my suitcase - and i mean going through my suitcase!!! anyways i had bought a carton of cigarettes before leaving canada and then had bought another at duty free in saskatoon. i had finished one carton while on vacation and there were six packs left in the other one which i packed back up in my suitcase. please keep in mind that my carry on also had an additional pack and a half that nobody took or said anything about when going through security. anyways they began accusing me that the cigarettes were narcotics even though the celephane was even still on the packages!!! i tried to explain that they were only cigarettes and a supervisor for security came over as well i had no idea what they were saying as i dont speak spanish. the lady then looked very worried and told me to leave the cigarettes and ask them if i could please go as they were about to arrest me!!! of course i did as she said and was near tears because i thought forsure i was going to jail for cigarettes. anyways after begging them and telling them that they could keep the whole suitcase if they wanted they let me go. thank goodness as the plane was just about to leave me there. i couldnt and still cant believe what happened. not to mention my poor spouse who had to stay on the plane and had no idea what was going on. it was a terrible experience and was very scary for me. so i must say that i will not be returning for these reasons. until it was time to leave we had a good vacation and now can sort of laugh about what happened. especially since i work in a drug rehab so if i had been arrested not sure how i would have told my boss what i had been arrested for. anyways wont be going back to the dr but had a good vacation overall and got lots of rr which is what we went for. anyone who has any additional questions please feel free to email me and i will try my best to answer. good luck and happy travels to you all and please make sure you dont have cigarettes in your luggage when you go home!!!!

rooms were smaller than some we have had in pc, but larger than others. they had attractive colours, blue, yellow and greens, and crown mouldings around the ceilings. energy efficient bulbs were of sufficient wattage to read, shave or apply make-up by. the dresser had deep drawers and the closets were enormous with plenty of hangers. it was spotlessly clean, and made up early in the day. water temperature and pressure were fine, and it is advisable to take down the handheld shower nozzle first until you get used to the operation. bed linens were not top quality but were pristine white and crisp. no extra blanket was needed if you set the a/c to a reasonable temperature. the large ceiling fans were wonderful, and we often left our patio door open at night to listen to the ocean with no worries of insects. the uvero alto area has a stiff breeze and this seems to preclude mosquito or fly infestations completely. we did not see a one. the flat screen tv had all manner of satellite channels and excellent reception the few times we actually turned it on to catch some cnn news. we had no water leaks, no interruptions from staff entering (a Huo Fei o not disturbHuo ?sign was always respected). one a/c malfunction was attended to with an hour of our report.restaurants on the night we arrived, there was a fire which burned the roof thatch off the main buffet. it is believed that it was an electrical malfunction to blame. fortunately there were no casualties. it was gratifying to see the initial shock turn to a full-bore cooperative effort on the parts of staff and guests alike, working in unison to clear the restaurant of furnishings, dishware and so on. iHuo Zui  like to think that this was an example of good old canadian helpfulness in a time of need; itHuo Chu  what we do. the management sent us a letter of thanks the next day. dominicans and canadians together make a good team!at no time did the fire interrupt the exceptional food service we received. the carite beach restaurant became our breakfast and lunch space for buffet servings. each night there has a theme. sunday night is the seafood gala which we enjoyed tremendously. there was also a pizzeria and the steakhouse a la carte available. we booked the steakhouse twice and had very delicious food here, including wings, quesadillas, caesar salad and a choice of grilled beef, sausage, pork and chicken. i heartily recommend the rib eye, and be sure to specify how you like it cooked, erring on the side of rare or blue if you like it red. there was a very nice argentinian malbec on their wine list which held up nicely to the grilled beef! favorites of our group of 6 were the breads, bocconcini and olives, omelets from marisol, the fantastic dominican tomatoes and pasta. the servers deserve much praise for their never-ending smiles, efforts to please and prompt attention to guests. we really enjoyed the service of ramito, angel and marcelina, among many!bars top shelf costs extra here, which is not a 5-star quality. we did manage to get fine drinks at the lobby bar and the pool Huo ?beer, gin and tonics, vodka chi-chis, champagne. careful with the boombooms! fluorescent drinks might not be the best choice if you tend to overindulge! thanks to henry and joseluis at the swim-up for hours of service and amusing banter. juanramon and daniel did a great job of keeping glasses full in the lobby, as did cristian in the sports bar.beach and pools great effort has been given to keeping the pool, hot tubs, and beach clean since the early days of negative reviews. uvero alto is almost always windy and the sand becomes airborne unless the area around the pool is kept hosed down. when the vegetation grows in more, it will form a break. washrooms, located near the pool and restaurants, were pretty much immaculate even after a long day of people in and out. abelardo has soft fluffy yellow towels for you as often as you feel you need them. beach is thoroughly raked and we saw very little glass, plastic or cigarette butts . . . canadians clean up after themsleves extremely well, even trying to recycle all the plastic water bottles/cups!! :) many of the palms are young, newly planted. there were ample palapas for the shade lovers and no contention about saving loungers as there were sufficient for all. sand is a pale yellow, not brown, soft and warm.grounds as with the palms, gardeners were at work every moment planting hibiscus, yucca, bougainvillea, crotons and other native species. we remember how much growth there was year to year when the grand paradise first opened, so colony bay will be lush and verdant by next fall. please be cautious walking on some of the rougher pathways back behind the buildings with the rooms Huo ?the concrete is uneven there. there are geese, ducks, flamingos and turtles in ponds in front of the lobby. their enclosures were drained and scrubbed clean twice in our week.activities and entertainment we knew the Huo Fei rillHuo ?of a day near the pool after so many trips south, so we were beach dwellers during the mornings. the animation team did the requisite stretching, aerobics and dance lessons daily. we politely suggested that they mix up the music for these activities a bit more! Huo Yu nchained melodyHuo ?haunts us still! lol they did not harass us to join in. we had full cooperation from these hardworking young people, especially when we saw a need to report some unseemly comments. turns out it was mostly a cultural thing, and apologies were accepted.the spa was also an experience worth mentioning Huo ?the masseuses were well-trained and did reflexology, chakra points, lymphatic drainage, shiatsu, deep-tissue, hot stone, and aromatherapy massages among other treatments! the anti-stress 80 minute massage left two of us feeling like we were walking on clouds afterwards.tours having done these other times, we opted to stay beached this year. as usual, other guests returning from excursions waxed poetic about their experiences in saona. a new one this year was freedom adventures to san rafael del yuma . . . reasonably priced! see patricia (she speaks french and spanish) in the jewellery boutique in the lobby for information. ask about lionel (lee-oh-nel) and his excursion. departure and check out we checked the sunquest book the night before and found that we had a delay of three hours in our departure time so we got to see our friends longer than we thought the next morning. when our bus did arrive, we were sad to leave our little community and new friends.conclusion the colony bay resort, its owners, management and staff, deserve kudos for running an operation this smoothly after being rushed to open for the Huo She igh seasonHuo ? two months in, i believe, and the other 5 people in our group concur, they made our stay a pleasure. the fault squarely lies in the promotion being done by the tour companies who have represented the hotel as a 4 1/2 or 5 star. we were appalled to discover that there were such disparities in the prices guests had paid for their one-week all-inclusive stays. we booked in october 2007. some who booked earlier paid much less, some more. imagine our dismay, also. to find that travellers from much farther air distances had paid one-third what we had for the same rooms, same service, same food and drink and the same march break week!!! though we are not litigious in nature, we do plan to approach this company from whom we have had superior service in the past, for compensation.what we loved best about colony bay was its small size Huo ?there were never any lineups anywhere. we actually saw the same people more than once during the week! we met some amazing folks at this small and intimate resort, and they and the staff made this one our best experiences on holiday. all our best wishes to colony bay as it grows and improves! michelle, sandi, leah, jeff, lynn, rick, chris, gino, patricia, audrey, veronica, dan, paige, cameron, hanna, patti . . . and all the others, thanks! where to next year, my friends?

we just escaped). but that's another story. our room was small, but comfortable with great balconies that offer everyone a view of the the water. i recommend dismantling the hotel key chain so you're not advertising the room number. you'll see when you get there. we tipped the hotel maid most days, but it didn't seem to help much with extras like towels, soap, pillows, just be prepared for the basics. the hotel itself is very nicely laid out. you are close to everything you need, the beach is fine. not the powdered sand you find closer to and south of punta cana, but quite acceptable anyway. the waves were really rough, but still a lot of fun to play around in. watch out for the kids, the undertow could be very strong. if you're into snorkling, i highly recommend taking the five minute walk down to dreams. you'll see an area that is roped with buoys. there's some really great snorkling in that area and the water is quite a bit calmer in the morning. reports of glass on the beach, etc in other reviews were not an issue. some of the shells can be a little rough, so flip flops are wise. we tipped often, a dollar or two here and there. the staff really appreciate it, but they never make you feel like it's required. the service is always with a smile. the entertainment was as you might expect on these types of resorts. great enthusiasm, lots of dancing and lots of lip-synching. this, i could mostly do without, though. some day a resort is going to get the brilliant idea of showcasing actual talent from the area. authentic music, dance, variety, - instead of trying to mimic broadway shows. i would find this much more interesting. i don't need to see another rendition of michael jackson or grease done to lip synching, bad wigs and too much makeup. oh well, it comes with the territory. we went on two excursions that were terrific. the carribean cruise on a catamaran - a 4 hour tour that ports in bavaro. offered some snorkling, swimming with sharks, and stingrays. it's worth the money and makes for an enjoyable half day. the staff go overboard (no pun intended) to make it a fun time. the other excursion and i highly recommend it, the monster truck safari. it's an all day affair that takes you through many villages, touring the country side, seeing an actual dominican farm, sampling some fruits, sweets, etc., a nice lunch buffet, and some more touring. all done on a reconditioned military vehicle that can handle the rough roads and the occasional shallow river. it seats about two dozen and the tour guide was very knowledgeable and had a good grasp of english. this money was well worth it as it gets you off of the resort and you get to actually see the people in their normal settings. the most unfortunate way to end the week was with the hotel check out staff. it's too bad to end on a note like this, but the employee was was tasked with the job of checking people out in the morning. most of his energy however, was spent trying to shake people down for mini bar items they didn't use and long distance calls they didnt make. it became an ongoing joke on the way to the airport after. they tried to pin me with some items from the mini bar that i quite simply did not use. i absolutely refused to pay. others complained of $15 and $20 worth of long distance phone calls. (in rooms where they didn't even have a working phone). i strongly suggest that the hotel / sunquest look into this. this is not the last memory you want your customers to have. however, aside from the check out experience...all in all, a nice week away from our miserable winter. i wouldn't hesitate to go to this resort and i expect it to improve once the learning curve straightens out a bit.

we have been to puerto plata dr, huatulco mx (x3), mayan riviera mx (x2), jamaica, bahamas, panama, along with numerous other non-caribbean destinations. we stayed at this resort from feb 23-mar 1 with 5 other couples. some of the things i will touch on may seem small and you may think i am overly picky. i simply want to give a comprehensive review - sometimes....all the small things add up and negatively affects your vacation.arrival - arrived at 2pm. room not ready but we were fine with this as check-in is not until 3pm. had lunch, came back at 3pm, and room was ready. room key is on a chain with a piece of wood that has the room number engraved on it. very easy to fix...just remove the piece of wood and stash it away until you have to check out.room - quality of workmanship in the room is very poor. caulking and grout work is very poorly done. there is already mildew over the grout in the shower and i'm not sure why as there is a bathroom fan - maybe it's not vented to the outside? accessories like soap dish and toilet paper holder are already rusted. the holes in the walls for the receptacles for wall plugs, thermostat, etc were made too big. walls are very thin. i could hear the man in the next room cough, amongst other things. if it is a very windy night, put a towel against the bottom of the room door or it will bang and rattle. beds are pretty comfortable but the sheets don't fit the bed - they are too short so, by morning, the bottom sheet is pretty much off the bed. there is a small flat screen tv with a variety of channels and the phones in the room now work. there is no clock so you may wish to bring a small travel clock. in spite of all the little things, we were one of the lucky ones. leaking pipes seem to be in a lot of rooms and this problem was not unique to just our group. we heard from many other people that they had water problems. one couple we travelled with had water leaking from the bathroom ceiling almost every day and maintenance could not seem to do a permanent fix. another couple we were there with had to be moved to a different room as the toilet apparently wasn't hooked up properly and backed up all over the room. yet another couple we were with kept having their air conditioning break down.food - average, just okay. there is a lovely pasta bar and i took advantage of this quite frequently. one woman said to me if there wasn't this pasta bar, i'd go hungry. maybe a little over the top but, indeed, the food wasn't great. we've stayed at many riu's, grand sirenis, gala and i would consider their food 5 star and this resort, in comparison, would be a 3 star at best. i will say they do a lovely job on their mexican-themed night. it was very tasty. given the ownership is italian, i would have thought their italian night would be stellar....average only. we did not try out the steakhouse but the rest of our group did. some liked, some did not. alcohol - as advertised, only the domestic alcohol is included (mostly normandy brand). it's not great but the bartenders can mask the taste with some pretty amazing drinks. the sports bar makes the best chunky monkeys! you can buy international booze at $5-7 per shot. staff - the resort's saving grace! from the grounds keepers, to the chefs, to the servers, to the bartenders, to housekeeping, etc. almost every staff member we came in contact with was wonderful. there were smiles all round and they wanted to make our stay a pleasant one. the only exceptions were the sunquest rep (who was replaced by someone else while we were there) and one gentleman at the front desk (see my comments under 'check out').beach - sunquest advertises this as a white sand virgin beach. white sand it is not. it is a beige sand. but it is nice and soft. unless you step on glass. i'm not sure why there is so much glass on this beach unless it is working it's way up through the sand. this would have been a vacant piece of land before the resort was built which probably had a lot of garbage dumped on it (this seems to be the norm in the dr on vacant land). by the end of each day, we had picked up and put into a cup anywhere from 5 to 15 pieces of glass - just in the immediate area around our palapa. it is very windy at this location so the waves are quite strong. we enjoyed body surfing..lot's of fun. if you are not a strong swimmer, be cautious and use your judgement as the flag telling you about water conditions went missing on day 2 and never returned. one young fellow (early 20's), got pulled under by an undertow and was being pulled out to sea - he managed to swim out of it by swimming parallel to the shore. oddly enough, the waves weren't as big on that day as they were on other days.palapas/beach chairs/towels - towel game is alive and well at the colony bay. we don't mind as we are very early risers when we are away and like to be up to watch the sunrise. we were therefore at the beach and choosing our palapa around 6am. my hubby would go with our mugs and get coffee and some pastries and we would watch the show. we watched many people from 6:00am onward put out their towels and leave for hours. the gentleman who is responsible for bringing down the towel cart at 6:30ish can be tipped to save a palapa for you. we had heard this from other guests and indeed we saw this in action. he had an assistant with him first thing and the two of them would wander around putting towels out on beach chairs/palapas around the beach and pool. one day we counted 9 bundles of towels at 5-6 towels per bundle that he put out for guests.pool - nice size. in-pool loungers are lovely. they did have some trouble regulating the chemicals for a few days and the pool was quite murky for 2 days. i think they shocked the heck out of it at that point which is good but, if you have sensitive skin, you may end up with a rash on your skin everywhere your bathing suit touches it (folliculitis). i know i do! i'm sure cortate cream will do the trick.amenities, etc - these are the following things that sunquest and this resort advertises which are not available at this time: sailboats, minigolf, video games room, conference centre. the fitness centre is not air conditioned and there are only three machines, one of which did not work. the casino is made up of about 10 slot machines and one black jack table. i think there is also a hold 'em table but i never saw anyone there.check out - this is where we had our only problem with a staff member. the fellow who checked us out (pm me if you wish to know who), tried to charge us for a long distance phone call that we never made. we kept in contact with our daughter via email (their internet prices are very good) and only used the phone once the whole week to call a couple in another room to give them a wake up call. this fellow became quite rude when i insisted we made no such call. i happened to see the owner in the lobby so i called him over. he said that yes i had made the call but it is no problem and i will not be charged. i very politely explained to him that it is a problem as i had made no such call and suggested he check his phone system.summary - to sum it up, sunquest advertises this resort as a 4 1/2 star and the resort gives itself a 5 star. i don't believe this resort will ever be more than a 4 star at best. they would have to tear the place down and start over to improve upon the poor workmanship. we stayed at the grand sirenis in the mayan riviera shortly after it opened last year and it has 1700 rooms per side. the workmanship there was far better.if anyone launching the complaint or suit against sunquest is reading this, please personal message me and i will give you my email as i definitely feel we should get a partial refund or travel vouchers for a future trip somewhere else. a month before we were there, this resort showed as fully booked. we met 3 couples there who live in our area that booked it only 2 weeks before they arrived and they paid $500 per person less than we did. we were told this is because many people pulled out due to bad reviews and sunquest tried to sell it cheap just to fill the rooms.i'm sorry about being so long-winded but i felt very strongly about making this review as comprehensive as possible.

at least, i was until i read some of the earlier reviews on trip advisor. it seemed like everybody was intent on pointing out all of the difficulties of staying at a brand new resort. however, since spending my birthday week in dr at a resort with the most beautiful ocean property, lush accomodations, and friendliest staff i have ever seen, i have simply come to the conclusion that some people aren't happy unless they're unhappy (you know the ones i mean - they always can find something to complain about!). i wanted a chance to set the record straight.first off, i wasn't kidding when i said that the elegance is set on the most beautiful beach i have ever seen. one day my husband and i went for a walk down the beach for an hour and a half one way, and as far as we could see, the white sandy beach had no end. it was always fairly windy, but that was pleasant because it kept us cool and comfortable. the water was generally wavy, but that made it more fun to bob the waves and body or boogie surf. as well, i had brought mosquito spray having heard about troublesome mosquitos, but honestly i only saw one mosquito during our entire week there.we stayed in a standard room with a king size bed and a pool view. our room was amazing - it was the size of two normal hotel rooms made into one. all of the fixtures were funky and fun, and the only complaint i could make is that the toilets were extremely loud when flushed (i'm a light sleeper). and finally i found a resort with a truly comfortable bed. the sheets were new and crisp, and the towels were soft and fluffy (whenever my husband dried his face, he was covered with yellow towel fluff). ah, new linens...there are five a la carte restaurants. our favorites were the steak house (chateau briand - wow!) and the italian. the buffets had a great selection and one week was not enough for us to get bored of the menus. but the real jewel of this resort is the staff. we found so many of the staff bent over backwards to make sure that we were having a fabulous time. in the restaurants and at the bars, cleanliness was meticulous. drinks were refilled often before you asked. our housekeeper seemed to straighten up after us about four times a day (it was very cute, because she would arrange the bed covers slightly different every time she came into our room most likely so we would know that she had been there). one word of note - many of the staff are new to resort employment and are struggling to learn english. although they will flawlessly ask, how are you?, they may not have any english beyond that. instead of speaking slowly and loudly (this does not make them understand you), try to keep your responses or questions simple. perhaps you can even help them learn a new word, because they are eager to communicate. i found smiling worked well :) i also need to mention the evening shows. they are breathtaking, and i was in awe of the performace skills of the entertainers. some shows were a little hokey, like the mr. magistic competition (a contest of humiliation, but still entertaining). my favorite show by far was the michael jackson show. or wait until you see madonna doing vogue at the music revue. the performers are incredibly athletic and talented - their dance abilities are incredible. they'll dazzle you with breakdancing like you've never seen before and seem to enjoy showing off their athletic abilities. all in all, this was the most beautiful and wonderful resort we've ever stayed at. there are a few new resort hiccups, but i found that they didn't seem to affect us. when our tv (big screen plasma by the way!) wasn't working, we phoned the front desk. an hour later we phoned again and after apologizing profusely they sent someone up who promptly fixed it for us. the landscaping is new, and although it hasn't filled in yet, it will be stunning as it continues to grow. about half of the guest rooms were finished (resort was at half capacity when we were there) and the rest seemed to be near the completion and setup stages, but we never heard any construction noise.it is useful to change your canadian money into american money before you leave home. although tips are unneccessary at this resort, i still brought a small stack of u.s. $1 bills and tried to show my appreciation to the staff. to me it's just a buck, but in their world it's a more substantial amount.my favorite things: the majestic drink (try it!), the lobby bar before dinner (we met so many interesting people from around the world - literally!), the evening entertainment shows (michael jackson was the best!), walking along the beach, boogie boarding, all of the staff members, our new friends from charleswood (if you're reading this then you know who you are!), the fitness gym, all of the neat ways our housekeeper made our bed four times a day (even if we hadn't used it)my less than favorite things: the appetizer at the french restaurant, the first 15 minutes in our room at the end of the day until the air conditioner got some of the humidity under control (all room power is on a motion sensor and it gets pretty warm when you 've been out for the hottest part of the day), speedo type g-string bikinis on mature men, having to come back home to winterso to sum it up, you can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of the people some of the time, and there are some people who will never be pleased unless they can find something to be displeased about. i was pleased all of the time, and i hope to return to this resort and see how it matures.

we just got back yesterday from a week's stay at the majestic elegance resort. there was myself, my partner, my 13 year old son and 10 year old daughter. we were very happy with everything during our stay. the room was luxurious and if you check out the website the pictures are very accurate. because we were a family of four and i didn't want my kids to stay in a room by themselves we originally booked a room with 2 beds. our first room had 2 beds but they were only slightly larger than single beds and wouldn't have worked for us. we went back to reception and they were happy to accomodate us. we ended up with a room with a king sized bed which also has a small day bed/couch that my daughter slept on and they provided another single bed which fit in nicely where the couch was. since there are many families with younger kids it would be a good option for them to have rooms with a king and maybe bunk beds or something similar - the rooms are large and can easily accomodate this set up. that was the only glitch of the week and was quickly resolved. the food at the buffet is plentiful and fresh with lots of choices. the restaurant at the beach also has daily breakfasts and lunches which were both very good. we ate at all the other a la carte restaurants. the steak house was excellent, japanese was fun with great food, italian was our least favourite but still very good. you have to get used to the somewhat slower and less efficient service at the restaurants - it's like that everywhere in the south so just accept it. we saw lots of people complaining about not getting their wine glass filled or their coffee first thing in the morning. very stressful holiday if this gets you down! we were there over new year's and went to the buffet for dinner. they went all out with the food - it was amazing!! the pool was fantastic, the beach was beautiful. we had perfect weather. the lobby bar and surrounding area is a great place to play cards, games etc. and they make really good cocktails! my favourite was the cosmopolitan! the entertainment is nightly in the theatre and all nights had great shows. i wanted a relaxing holiday and didn't really leave the resort. i was expecting to get a bit bored but did not at all. a very beautiful resort with lots to do, fantastic food and great service. we had a great trip!***one caution about the beach. . . if you like to walk on the beach there is an area about a 20 minute walk west where the ocean is quite rough. it is directly in front of a huge resort that is currently being built. we went in one day and body surfed the waves which was great fun. my kids went into shore and i followed about 10 minutes after them. by the time i went in the currents had changed drastically. i am a very strong swimmer and used to be a life guard so i know how dangerous water can be. the undertow from the waves was so strong that i could barely stand in 3 ft. of water. i was only a few feet from shore so managed to get in by getting 'surfed' in by the oncoming waves. my partner came in a few minutes after me and is also a very strong swimmer and is very safe. he was trying to swim front crawl toward shore and was being taken out further into the ocean (going backwards!). he eventually did the same as me and surfed himself in. this was only 5-10 minutes after i had come in and the currents changed that quickly. i was very thankful my kids had already gone in. the next day my partner walked along the beach again and in the same spot there was a man on shore that had drowned. the body was still on the shore and there were many police there so it had just happened before he had come upon it. very, very scary. they should be posting warnings at this area and also informing guests as part of the info that you get when you arrive.

(btw - if you have kids, get a second room, there is no privacy in the toilet or bathroom at all). back to the hotel - i had a nice conversation with one of the managers and they quietly blame the construction company. the main issue in reality is the quality of construction, which is very very poor. so, no matter how hard the staff tries, i don;t see these issues going away soon. we did experience a leak from the light in the bathroom when taking the shower on our last day of stay, which tells me they will keep finding problems for months, if not years to come. the patch work is visible and something new appears daily. with the economy being where it is and given a stiff competition in punta cana area, there is nothing special about me to pay for. there are plenty of other places in punta cana, where the food is great, the staff is trained and the accommodations are good. we did not hate our stay, but unless vacation is deeply discounted, we won't go to elegance again. it;s your vacation, your time and your money - why even have a little hassle, when you don;t have to. the resort is striving to provide luxurious experience, but comes short in a few areas. family of 4.

but after one, it doesn't matter so much anymore) and a fruit plate waiting for us. upon first walkthrough, i immediately noticed a few craftsmanship issues: one light fixture was crooked, like a level hadnHuo Zhua  been used to put it up, there was recessed lighting in a nook above each bed and there was a spot where a hole had been cut and then they figured out it was wrong and they cut another hole for the light Huo ?the first hole was poorly patched and painted over, the marble (Huo Ming sh?) shower looked wonderful (and was Huo ?4 different water outputs which was very relaxing), but some of the faucet fixtures had holes a bit larger than the fixture (it appeared they didnHuo Zhua  have the right tools to accurately cut and fit holes for them? so that was a little unappealing cosmetically), the showers did leak into the toilet area (but not into our room and it wasn't an overwhelming leak), our tv wasnHuo Zhua  on the wall (which wasnHuo Zhua  a concern at all) but it didnHuo Zhua  work and our ceiling fan didnHuo Zhua  work. we called about the ceiling fan and the tv and a repair guy showed up in less than a minute. he was able to fix both. the only other issue with the rooms was that our a/c didnHuo Zhua  seem to work as well as others in our group, but it was adequate and we did have a sewage smell/fresh drywall (yeah, if you can imagine that?) that was quite overwhelming upon first walking into the room, but we got used to it quickly, so it couldnHuo Zhua  have been that bad. it was much worse our last day there, so we werenHuo Zhua  sure if it was an issue of more people starting to check in and straining the plumbing or not? this smell was not an issue in the other 2 rooms our group had. although these cosmetic issues aren't impacting on my fun, i do think if they're aren't reviewed and fixed, it will affect people's overall perspective on this resort eventually. in the beginning, they can be overlooked, but they shouldn't still exist in an established 4 star (5?) resort.some in our group had maid/turn down service 2-3x a day with the maids making the beds if theyHuo Zui  been in for a nap, but we only had maid service 2x in 5 days. they have sensors outside the rooms that tell the employees when the room is occupied so they know when they can enter and one of our roommates slept at odd hours, so that might explain the sporadic maid service. the swim-up rooms are nice and will be nice when the landscaping is better. the ground outside our room was lumpy and the shrubs separating us from our neighbors are baby shrubs and not exactly effective. it wasnHuo Zhua  exactly a Huo Gan ardenHuo ? but if the Huo Yuan ardens' outside the majestic colonialHuo Chu  equivalent rooms are any indication, this will eventually be a very nice amenity of these rooms. restaurantsjapanese Huo ?we sat at one of the teppan-yaki grills. they serve chicken, beef, shrimp, fried rice and vegetables. not as good as some of the ones iHuo Ji e been to, but it was good for an ai. italian Huo ?in our group we covered most of the menu selections. everyone was happy with their main selections. their caesar salad was made with real anchovies, which iHuo Hui  not used to, but it was ok and the chicken on it was a little dried out and tough. see/sea Huo ?the buffet by the beach during the day, seafood restaurant at night. i had the continental breakfast here once (so-so), and i ate lunch here daily. good variety, but my favorite was probably the pasta station. this is converted to a sit down seafood restaurant in the evening. two of our group tried it one night and they werenHuo Zhua  impressed, but once again, this could be hit/miss. steakhouse Huo ?i didnHuo Zhua  go to, but my group did. they were disappointed. they said the food wasnHuo Zhua  that good and the portions were too small. to present the other side of this, we did talk to other people whoHuo Zui  eaten there and they liked the restaurant a lot, so it sounded like it was hit/miss. gourmet (didnHuo Zhua  try)flavours Huo ?the buffet for breakfast/lunch/dinner near the lobby. similar to the lunch buffet. i only ate breakfast here once. it wasnHuo Zhua  great, but it was suitable. iHuo Ji e had better at aiHuo Chu . it had the right stuff to be a good breakfast buffet, so hopefully it will improve. i never ate there for lunch, but the dinner buffet was decent. as with any buffet, some of it is great, some is not so great. i particularly liked the pizza, pasta and lasagna. iHuo Hui  of the mindset that you donHuo Zhua  go to an ai for food quality and this was sufficient enough that iHuo Hui  on a Huo Qian ost vacation dietHuo ?

poolthe pools are very nice Huo ?winding throughout the length of the property from the lobby area toward the beach. plenty of lounge chairs and little palapas for shade. since we were there when the hotel wasnHuo Zhua  at full capacity, we always had options for a quieter place to lay out or the option to be down by the activities and the swim-up beach bar. beachthe beach is beyond beautiful. i could not ask for more. i didnHuo Zhua  participate in any of the free water activities, but it appeared to be open and ready for kayaking, windsurfing, etc. they rake the beach for seaweed and are out picking up trash all the time. the sand is wonderful, the water is clear, blue-green and good enough for swimming out a bit and in either direction for a while.entertainmentwe went to the michael jackson, magic, and circus show and the Huo Ni ight of the starsHuo ?(cher, celene dion, janet jackson, britney spears, usher, freddie mercury impersonations). the staff works hard to put on a good show, and they were entertaining. two nights we ventured to the sports bar/disco after the theater show and it was fun to go and dance for a little while. they have a few tvHuo Chu  and a dj that plays all kinds of dance music. itHuo Chu  a small area and smoking is allowed in there. there are a lot of lounge areas that make it nice for just hanging out and drinking, talking, playing games, etc. in the evening.constructionone entire building was still being worked on. you could see the rooms stacked with boxed fixtures, mattresses, etc., but the ongoing work never disturbed us at all.there were random power outages, but they were always very short (less than a minute, that we know of) and most of the time we werenHuo Zhua  in the room anyway. internet pricesfor the non-elegance club people, you could buy a pin number for a laptop in your room for $10 for 24 hours or the business center was $5/30 mins. i'm not sure about the elegance club.

the food was very good overall. there was one restaurant closed(rotating) each night due to the occupancy rate.sea  see: seafood for dinner. we had lobster, salmon, and shrimp entrees, all were great, appetisers we enjoyed were octopus, lobster bisque and cream clam soup, again fantastic. dessert bar was tasty but not great. we had brandy, amaretto and coffee. lunch buffet at sea  see was extremely good, selections from pizza, pasta bar(cooked to order), big salad and sandwich bar, cooked to order burgers, hot dogs, steak and fish. the paella was delicious as well as hot chicken and beef dishes. italian: for lunch we had seafood risotto, gnochi with red sauce, veal carpaccio, procuitto with melon, capresse salad and lasagne. for dinner, veal saltimboca, eggplant parm and veal parm, as well as misc pasta. the food in the italian ranged from phemominal to good, they are still getting consistent, we never had anything we didn't like, never had room for dessert.gourmet: this is where they need some work, fixed menu, we went twice and the meals were the same. also, the food was not as good as the other restataunts. wine list is at a supplemental payment. at this point i do not recommend the gourmet. steak house: steak melts in your mouth and was cooked to perfection. we had the cowboy steak, chateaubriand, and ribs. plenty of sides to choose from. breakfast buffet: fantastic selection, eggs cooked to order, pre-cooked omelettes, fried and scrambled egge for those in a hurry. plenty of bacon, sausage, fresh fruits, cereal, juices, smoothies, breads, yogurts, pancakes etc. we also ate a la carte breakfast at the italian which was very good. we also had continental breakfast in the elegance club lounge, espresso machine, sweet rolls, cold meats/cheeses and juice.room service: we ordered burgers and champagne twice as well as cocktails. burgers were great and all was delivered in a timely manner. lobby bars have the best selection of premium liquors, see manuel, he'll take great care of you. all bars are open and running, the bartenders and servers will take care of you. the restaurant staff goes way out of thier way to give you the best service possible. they are truly professional and really want you to enjoy yourself. some are new to this profession, so please be patient while they get some experience, i believe they know their jobs but are a little nervous due to rude guests mistreating them. beach/pools/grounds: beach: we walked on the beach most days, the elegance beach is nicer than surrounding resort beaches. we heard of guests on the beach from other resorts asking about the elegance because it's so nice. plenty of loungers and palapas. server to bring your drinks, bar nearby if you want to hang out.elegance club pool: we had a bali bed all day every day, pool is beautiful, talk about being spoiled, water was perfect.main pool: great pool, more loungers than people, great bar and bartenders. grounds: groundskeepers everywhere working for perfection, it'll take a little while for vegetation to grow, and every detail to be perfect but they're at it constantly. still some lighting, speakers etc to be installed, but they make great progress everyday. activities on and off the resort/hotel: the animation teams were at it at the pool and beach, we are loungers, but those involved seemed to be having a great time. we went to the casino and disco at the colonial and enjoyed ourselves, they could use a good cleaning but were passable. my wife had a massage at the colonial spa and loved it. both the elegance and colonial have nightly shows. the elegance has live music outdoors each evening weather permitting. we did not do any excursions outside of the property. other comments: we were a little nervous going in due to the negative reviews (which were true from what we were told while we were there) but all was fixed/adjusted as far as we felt. any new operation will have problems when it opens. the staff is no less than phenominal, we were treated like royalty. they strive to enhance your stay as time goes on, i just can't say enough about them. the resort is beautiful and will be better and better as the days go by. there was a little bit of noise from the workers, but they have to get it all done. the ongoing work didn't bother us. if you stay in the elegance club and henry is your butler you will be amazed how he works to make your stay perfect.

']","beautiful beach first day- arrived nov 21 part of a sunwing group- the very first guests of the majestic elegance- surprise-surprise! sunwing had told us that this hotel had been taking guests since october. we were dropped off at the colonial by the sunwing bus operator, who was then forced to load us back up and take us to the elegance.the lobby and lower bar area was/is magnificent, even with the unfinished drywall and construction debris. the poor check-in men looked as if the computers had just been switched on and that they did not yet know what to do with the computers or with us. first issue-sunwingHuo Chu  description of our room did not match any description of any rooms that the elegance had to offer. ricardo swung into action and sent us to the elegance club check-in area, with the promise that calix would look after us. after a long trip through the construction site, past workers, tools, barrows, wires, etc, i asked the bellboy to stay with our luggage- thinking we may need to get out of there. inside the elegance check-in area calix and his staff were doing everything they could to get their guests comfortable and then moved into rooms that the construction workers had not yet moved out of. the torrential rain caused flooding of the check-in area floor and water was dripping out of numerous areas in the plaster ceiling. the air conditioning was not working, and there were no restaurants open, so we waited. after 2 hours we were taken to the room by calix, the bellboy had stayed (great staff), and upon informing him that this room still did not match the sunwing description, he told us he would get us moved again, we waited in the room for another 2 hours, not having a key to the room, no tv, no drinks in the fridge, no hot water, no telephone, no internet, no ac- lots of construction noise. 2 hrs passed Huo ?i went and found calix- talking on 2 phones at the same time, with the walkie talkie on his belt, standing by the pool watching the men cutting the marble for the overflow drain to be installed. he told me we would have to stay in the room over night- that there were no more rooms available.we went for supper at the italian resturant- i have to say the staff is tremendous- but the meal was late and cold- it took us 2 hours to eat.the first issue continued into the next day- still no other room available, with calix promising to find us one sometime in the futureHuo ?finally after lunch i told him to forget it i would settle this room issue with sunwing. the room we had was nice, i liked the sunken area and the layout. it was on the south side of the resort facing the vacant lot, and was very private with a view of the ocean and the wreck off the coast.second issue-lack of hot water Huo ?we had cold water on the 21st, tepid water on the 22nd, hot water on the 23rd , 24th, 25th, back to cold on the 26th, tepid on the 27th, and hot on the 28th. at least twice during our stay the toilet was hooked to hot water, and on at least 4 separate times the water would be shut off for a period of time.third issue Huo ?electricity Huo ?the power could go off at any time during the day for any length of time with no warning. this happened at least 2 times a day, each day, every day.fourth issue- construction workers and construction noise throughout the entire week. construction workers and bikini clad women donHuo Zhua  mix well (no offense to us construction workers). the noise was continuous throughout the day. they were still building the marble countertops for the pool bar in the elegance club area, and the grinders are quite noisy. as well as hammer drills, hammers, etc as the electricians did their thing.fifth issue- lack of lighting- the walkways in the central garden and pool area did not have the lighting completed until the 26th, (it does look quite spectacular now even with the immature vegetation, to stand at the top of the stairs in the main lobby at night, and look out through the arches towards the ocean is spectacular). the lack of lighting in the corridors still was not addressed by the time we left nov 28th. this meant that as you walked to your rooms you moved from lit corridors into dark areas, this happened on both sides of the complex. the hotel provided security men with nightsticks to stand in these darkened areas.sixth issue Huo ?restaurants Huo ?we really enjoyed eating at this hotel. simply because of the people who were serving us. for the most part they were extremely cheerful and always did their best to help us. however the restaurants were not all open at the same time, and even if they were open, all menu items were not available. the italian restaurant experience on our first day kept us out of it until, the 26th for supper- it was very nice and hot. the steakhouse or as we affectionately called it Huo ?Huo Shi he rodenthouseHuo ? (we were there when the rat dropped out of the ceiling on the large table)- was great. we ate there 4 of the nights we were there. each night the service and the meals got better. the corn and chicken soup was tremendous. the beach house was dark at night for eating. they had not yet got all the lights working and it was ok food but not great. we ate lunch usually at the buffet in the colonial which brings us to the seventh issue.seventh issue- access to the colonial- ricardo and calix and our sunwing rep jenner all told us to go to the colonial and that we were free to use their services. the first 2 days of our trip, no one had told the colonial that and we were hassled, especially regarding internet access. the last 3 days we had to take a long walk detour, through a darkened area and on part of the service road.eighth issue- life safety- no fire extinguishers, no pressure at the fire hose cabinets and intermittent hydro and water left me feeling unsafe.ninth issue- our room really was not ready. the tv was hooked up on our 3rd, but was not hung from the wall on the bracket. the room sensors are a good idea but were not operational, and as a result staff would walk in on you after knocking. the pass thru service system, is another good idea but not yet working. there was no literature, no info of any kind in the room. no dvd player, no dvds either, the library was empty. the ceiling in the shower fell down unto the floor that last morning we were there. it just wasnHuo Zhua  ready yet for guests. the butler system, maid service, bar service all will be great, but arenHuo Zhua  there yet.overall, we had a good time. we met new people- shared the adventure together. got sun, swam in the ocean enjoyed the beach and the people.being a novice to package trips, how sunwing could sell packages to a hotel without any pre inspection is beyond my comprehension.

']","disappointing we stayed at the magnolia hotel while in dallas for a family wedding. most of our family from all over the country stayed at the hotel also. after a very easy, quick check in process, we had to wait 10 minutes for an elevator. this proved to be a problem all weekend. our room on the 17th floor was very nice. it isn't the typical rectangular hotel room, which is great for us. the bathroom had a large garden tub and shower, and the bed was very comfortable. we had a pretty good view of downtown dallas.we immediately went to the fitness center - we took the stairs after waiting 5 minutes for an elevator. the fitness center is ok, but not great. a few older cardio machines, some dumbells, and a universal gym. there are 3 tvs.we called the valet to bring our car around 10 minutes before we had to leave for the rehearsal dinner. we went downstairs, and waited an additional 10 minutes for the car. this would also prove to be a problem all weekend.we found out there were some other events going on in the hotel this weekend - a wedding, a youth conference, and the eagles (the band, not the football team) were staying there. the first night we hardly slept because of the noise from the street, and from the elevators. we could hear all the people on the street until about 3 am. i know this is not at all the fault of the hotel management, but something to know if you're looking to stay here. in the morning i went to have the complimentary breakfast buffet. it is a pretty good spread - waffles, bacon, cereal, bagels, starbucks coffee. the main issue i had was that omelettes are $6.95. my feeling is that if you advertise a complimentary breakfast, it should all be complimentary. my sister-in-law just wanted scrambled eggs and was told by the omlette maker she wouldn't be charged. however, she received a bill for them anyway. that evening, i called for my car 20 minutes before i headed downstairs. this time it took us 15 minutes to get down in the elevator (we weren't going to walk down because my wife was in heels). we were already running late, and my car still wasn't down there. we finally got the car 40 minutes after i called for it. i must say the valets were frazzled all weekend. i don't think it was their fault. the system is bad. there is no parking garage nearby, so every time the valet gets the keys, he would take of running for the car a few blocks away. also, there is only one way in and out, which makes for gridlock. when we checked out, i noticed i was paying $22 per night (plus tax) for valet service, which nearly made me late to 2 events. the woman at the front desk was nice enough to take one of the valet nights off, but could do no more. everyone checking out at the same time had the same complaints - valet service, elevators, charge for eggs. this is a beautiful hotel with great rooms, but i would not stay there again, nor recommend it.

']","great value- pleasant accomodations good looks for low price and worth your time to try out this hotel. located near the dallas north tollway and beltline in far north dallas, this is not your average laquinta-- it is much better. the staff is laid back but curteous. a shuttle van is available if requested ahead of time. the breakfast is plain, but better than many cheap hotels. the hotel serves people internationally so expect to see a variety of people, styles of clothing, and ages.what you see in the hotel's pictures is what you will see when you arrive. the hotel looks new which means it has good upkeep. the hotel primarily serves business people who work in the huge office buildings around it. when you are in the hotel, you feel as if you are in the countryside. there is a very large indoor couryard which has a gazebo and real tables if you want to side outside to eat or converse. the pool is decent in size. i did not swim in it but one of the guests complained of too much chlorine. the fitness center is small, but has something for everyone and a tv inside. the laundry room has 2 washers and 2 dryers and current cost $1.50 to wash. soap costs $1.00.now for the room. my room looked new, but had a serious dent in the door, the toilet flushed loud and hard (but it flushed) and the white underblanket on my bed had a sticky stain on it like gum or caramel. since i was alone, i moved to the other bed which was clean. i found a small stain in the mostly white bathroom which should have been noticeable and cleaned. the bathtub, also white did not look clean at first then i noticed that the nonslip surface had worn off leaving dark marks. everything in the room looked new. the heating and air system was great because it was controlled by a digital thermostat that i could control very specifically. the desk was serviceable with enough room for a laptop and books.the beds were my worry. they turned out just fine. the beds are firm with a mattress top. i awoke refreshened.the design of the room was pleasantly different. the rooms are small, but the design makes the most of the space so i did not feel cramped. a family or group would have plenty of space.this is the largest laquinta i have ever stayed it. it has over 300 rooms. the lobby is super large so if someone wants to stay up and talk at night, they can.the atmosmere is a mixture of business, family, and friends. the galleria mall is a short drive away-- very short.the hotel only serves breakfast, but they have established room service with restaurants to deliver from about 11am to about 10pm. i chose to book online after looking over the various offers put together by trip advisor. the going rate for the room is $119. i suggest calling the hotel to see what rate that they offer, then go from there to see if the online offered a better deal. the first night, the online service had the best deal but said there were no other rooms available after that. i talked to the hotel staff the next day and they said they had rooms available but the online service charged more than the hotel offered me. the hotel has a lot of rooms available so try to negotiate for the best rate. they need to fill their rooms and you are the one to fill them.the previous reviews from trip advisor helped me pick this hotel and i was not disappointed. thanks trip advisor for being there. i have been using trip advisor for years and this is the first time i have thanked the company for its continued service to the consumer.what i did not like? i would like to see more maintenence repair on damaged areas like the doors to the room, stains on blankets and bathrooms, and repairs to damaged surfaces in the elevator. i would like to see a business center which surprisingly the hotel has zero. the hotel had wireless internet for its business customers which i liked. also there were no shower caps in the rooms. being on the 3rd floor, traveling downstairs to get the showercap was an inconvenience. the beds are small. the pillows are nice and fluffy, but small.i recommend this hotel for everyone.
