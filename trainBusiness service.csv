fine for the two small kids to sleep together, but we'd like at least a queen, which we are used to. again, i'll request this next time. tour tips: forget the space needle. $50 for the family and while the view is awesome, you're up there for about 20-30 minutes unless you stay for a refreshment. not worth it unless you're dying to see the lay of the land on a very nice day and have $50 burning a hole in your pocket.emp- same price as the needle, but it was 4 hours of great stuff to do. hands on music experience, as well as a science fiction hall of fame attached. fabulous for kids or those who are into this. we thought our kids might get bored. they didn't and since we went after 3:30 (it closes at 5) they stamped our tickets to return the next day, which we did. can't say enough about it.science centre: again, great value and if you're from vancouver and have a science world membership, you get in free. but even if you pay the $30 or so for the family, there's lots to see with a great dinosaur exhibit, butterfly room and plenty more.restaurants: of course lots in the area, and we loved the thai food places.parking;

(about 1/2 block south of the hotel) for a very inexpensive breakfast a couple of days. one day we walked a few blocks to a nearby coffee shop (no, not starbucks...we avoided corporate coffee), cafe ladro. very good coffee and pastries and worth the 6 or 7 blocks to walk.dinners were mostly eaten in and around the market area. we can highly recommend shiro sushi (again, within easy walking distance) and it was highly recommended to us by one of the front desk staff.

(not a place for small children as there weren't even screens) to get a breeze. that made for a terribly loud night's sleep. the carpet was creepy (not necessarily dirty, but dingy) and i kept shoes on my feet at all times.the bathroom was the pits. it was old and you had to step up about 18 into the smallest shower i've ever seen. the thing that killed me and i'm not sure why but the toilet didn't have a cover. just a seat. like you're using the bathroom at a rest stop. since the bathroom was so small, there was no place to put your toiletries and i was afraid that anything i precariously perched on the edge of the sink was going to fall into the toilet. i carried on a lot about the toilet not having a cover and i think my husband got tired of listening to me but i just found it really strange! (we stayed in a quality inn in los angeles for less than moore hotel and the qi had coffee makers in the room and continental breakfast (and free parking) and was way nicer than moore.)the positive of the place is that the location is bonus and the rate is fair, keeping in mund what you get for that rate. it's about 3 blocks from pike's market which is central. we walked to the space needle and i'd say it was a good mile's walk, but definitely do-able. there's coffee about a block in either direction, but you still have to leave the building.another minor benefit was internet access in the lobby but even though they post a 15 min time limit, it was in use all the time.i probably wouldn't stay here again. i've never stayed in a hostel, but this place is what i think a hostel would be like. i'm too old for that!! if you're young and/or don't care a bit about amenities this place is fine to sleep, though the bed was cheap and semi-comfortable. this place epitomizes the phrase you get what you pay for. i ",2.0

(actually, i think the mattress at the best western over by seattle center was better the one time i stayed there.)the trains. we were in a city-view room, as it was a priceline reservation. we were offered an upgrade to water view for $50 / night, but didn't take it as we weren't tourists  didn't need the view -- i didn't think about the train tracks, though. combined with the rock hard mattress, the trains squealing by all night make it pretty difficult to sleep. avoid city-view rooms.the keys. they demagnetize at the drop of a hat, which led to awkward moments where neither my husband or i could get into the room. the desk staff said it happens all the time if you put the key near credit cards or cell phones. okay, well, where are you going to carry the key if not in a purse or wallet, both of which appear to be landmines of key demagnetization? management clearly knows about it; why is it not fixed? no other hotels have this problem.the size of the rooms. teeny, as already mentioned here. we only just had space to walk between the queen-sized bed and the chair. the little things (also quite mixed):the nickel-and-dime routine. if a cafe two blocks away gives me free wireless with my $2 coffee, why can't the edgewater give its customers free wireless with their $100+ room? if i can park on the street for free right outside the hotel, why charge $28/night for parking? (not to mention i think $28/night is the most expensive hotel parking i've ever seen in seattle.)weird layout. for some patrons, the long walk may be difficult. the lobby isn't in the middle of the hotel, like in most places -- you check in and then all the rooms are down a long, long, narrow hallway. the elevator is halfway down that hallway, not near the lobby. so it could be difficult for elderly or handicapped patrons to navigate.the number of people. because it's on the water it's an event hotel. you'll see a lot of people in the narrow hallways and and in the lounge / lobby. we didn't have much problem with noise in the hallways up on the fourth floor, though, fortunately.no name toiletries. the sort you'd expect in a mid-level chain, not a place trying to be upscale. also, a very strong, not very pleasant scent to them. they were supposedly from a spa in the noble house chain (basically the same as generic holiday inn toiletries). it didn't exactly make me feel i was in a hotel worth $300 a night (good thing i didn't pay that).the fireplace. nice idea, but ours didn't work. it had a pilot light on all night, but no matter what we did with the thermostat the fireplace wouldn't light. we tried the timer as well and that also didn't work. trying to sleep across from the pilot light, combined with the train noise and the hard mattress, was difficult.the curtains. two choices -- completely shut and blocking all light, or completely open and flashing the street as you dress. i like having some light in the room during the day, even while i'm getting up  getting ready, so a set of sheers behind the heavy curtains would have been nice, and you usually see that in hotels, but the edgewater just had one set of heavy curtains. many of these are not big things, but small touches that, when neglected, show that the edgewater isn't an upscale hotel worth the money they charge. if you can book a water-view room for under $100 on priceline, it's worth it. if not, it's not.

the room looks very nice and overall breakfast was pretty good. they had sausage patties and egg patties (similar to what you would get at mcdonalds but tasted a little better). they also had cold cereal, bread for toast, bagels, and a small selection of pastries which could have been better. one of the nice things is they had waffle makers. also, they had a good selection of coffee and four different kinds of juices.finally, the room was what i expected it to be. it wasnHuo Zhua  large but big enough to fit a king size bed and still have plenty of room to walk around. it had an approximately 21Huo ?tv with a large selection of channels. it had an approximately 3Huo Jia 3Huo ?table and two night stands. in the closet there was an electronic safe which was large enough to fit my laptop the bathroom was old and could use some updating but my only real issue would be that there was only a shower which could be a problem if you wanted to take a bath. also, the room had free wireless internet which worked about half the time.the staff was very friendly and helpful. i was told they were going to be upgrading the internet and hopefully it would be more reliable then. there was a flier in the elevator that said they hoped to be done with phase 1 of the upgrades this summer. i should also mention there were two computers in the lobby available for guest use and when we arrived there was a printer attached to one of them but they took out the printer about half way through out stay. i wasnHuo Zhua  using it so i didnHuo Zhua  ask if they would be putting it back or what happened to it.as i stated before, overall i was happy with hotel and would probably stay here again. all my wife and i want when we go on vacation is a clean and safe place to sleep as we spend very little time in our room. probably the worst part was the neighborhood which unfortunately they have very little control over.

(in summer, one might have to keep that in mind.) after traveling for 24 hours the noise did not really bother us. the room was spacious, clean, it had a safe and a small fridge which came in handy. there is a bit of a gap between the room door and the floor which lets through a bit of light in the evening (if you like to sleep in total darkness like i do), but a towel quickly sorted that out. our towels were nice and fluffy and that there was no bath did not bother us at all. the hotel lift is a bit stuffy. the breakfast is quite a sugary affair but coffee, orange juice, a wonderful washington apple and a bagel can set you up for the start of the day. i would definitely stay there again.

quite a bit of luggage between the six of us and even though there were at least two bellmen standing in the lobby chatting, no one helped us with our bags or even wheeled us a luggage cart--we found one ourselves and took care of it. not necessarily a complaint and we weren't trying to be lazy, but the place comes off as a high end establishment and you usually get help with your bags up to your rooms--particularly when the bellmen are just standing there. check in was simple, but the clerk wasn't very warm or friendly. parking was $28/night, valet only, which is apparently standard in the area, but still seemed high to me. the rooms were tastefully decorated and the furniture and furnishings were nice. the bathroom had marble sinks and l'occitane products. there were robes hanging in the closet for our use, but were old, scratchy and in animal prints. a nice gesture, but i don't imagine many people make use of them. there was a basket of goodies and a fridge stocked with cold drinks and wine at a premium price. there was a hair dryer and iron, but no coffee pot, though it was free in the mornings in the lobby. beds were very comfy. i personally made the reservations--3 rooms each with the description of a king premier room--so we were very surprised to learn that each of the three rooms were very different in terms of space and amenities. our room was medium sized--the bed took up about half of the room with very little room to walk on either side of it. there was a small love seat, desk and chair and armoire all crammed together. our bathroom was larger then the others. one set of travel companions, also supposedly in a king premier room, had a much larger room with what appeared to be much newer furnishings and a tiny bathroom. the final couple were placed in a room so tiny it was difficult to plop thier luggage down and had a queen bed instead of a king. they ended up having to be moved in the middle of the night because the air conditioning in their room inexplicably turned on during an all ready chilly evening and wouldn't turn off. the employee that arranged for the move made a big deal that they were moving them to an upgraded room because that was all that was available and told them they should be really grateful not having to pay extra. this made absolutely no sense, considering the room that they were moved to was smaller then the one i was staying in with no extra amenties or anything else to speak of, yet thiers was considered an upgrade while our was supposed to be standard. we booked three of the same type of rooms at the same price with the same description, yet got three completely different results. seems they have several styles and floorplans and label the rooms whatever they want. check out was a madhouse. there were more then a dozen people waiting for a cab, with clueless bellmen and valet drivers running around mixing people's luggage up. we paid more then $300 per night, per room and expected a little more in terms of service. we had such a great time in seattle and i try not to think too badly of the hotel, but i will not stay there again when i return. bottom line: a nice place with decent amenities, but the hotel tries to come off more ritzy then it actually is.

(this allows for easy wheelchair access.) when you run the shower, the water goes under the curtain and all over the floor. it even leaked into the room. after two days, i learned to roll up damp towels and create a dam around the shower. also, the towel bar was sagging and about to fall out. in addition, housekeeping had a hard time remembering to restock soaps (two times) robes (several times) and other small housekeeping items in the room. although the staff politely took care of things, it seemed that i had at address one or two similar issues almost daily. the exhaust fan was noisy - not befitting a hotel of this price and star rating. some issues took repeated requests.the temperature control in the room is a simple window air unit. this unit is very noisy - again, not befitting a hotel of this price and star rating. when it rains, the rain and the roof runoff pounds down on the metal housing. as a result, you get the sound of water torture all night. i wound up opening a window (on the 9th floor) and straddling the windowsill in order to throw a hand towel on the top of the air conditioner. this got rid of the noise and almost got me killed. (ha!)the worst thing was that the wake up service was not working. i did set the alarm as a back up but it is very complicated and it didnHuo Zhua  go off. as a result, i missed my meeting. advice Huo ?bring your own clock. i addressed with the manager on duty who promised to take care of it, but i donHuo Zhua  recall an explanation or an apology or even notification if the problem was fixed or not. i took my chances a couple of days later and it worked. the busniess center: when i was there, the business center was sometimes used by children who needed extensive myspace fixes and im sessions. the front desk: the desk clerks were great. they were quick with conversation and a smile. they were always courteous and helpful. hotels like this have staff that reek of attitude, but the staff at the max was very welcoming and approachable.breakfast: the attached restaurant is a popular place. the asian restaurant offers breakfast as well, but the offerings are basic breakfast food at (eggs and hash browns) with foo-foo names at very high prices. breads and pastries were greasy and were comparable to items from a filling station. the fruit promised on the menu was simply aged, brown garnish left over from the night before. the coffee, however, was fantastic and kept me coming there for breakfast several times. i am a glutton for punishment. if you are not a coffee lover, avoid this place at all costs for breakfast. final verdict: after stripping away the pretty faMang ade, and the friendly service, you have a minimum service hotel. this could compare to the motels down the block (*6th avenue inn, 8th avenue inn, travelodge) at half the price. this place is simply a place to sleep and very much worth the standard 89-109 dollars charged at properties of similar services or quality. we paid over $150 a night and after considering the ups and downs of this place, we felt a bit violated by that high price. if you must stay here, try to find a better rate online or try to negotiate with the reservations agent.conclusion: all in all, it was an ok stay. it was a safe and clean place to stay and we did appreciate feeling welcomed as a same-gender couple. however, now that i know the city better, there are places with the same level of service and comfort at much lower prices. despite the welcoming staff and the cool dMao cor, there would have to be a serious upgrade in service, cut in price and/or improvement in the rooms before i would consider the max again.stayed: march 19-25, room 914 ",2.0

(for those of you who know seatac hotels, this is the old red lion. need i say more?)priceline gave me an excellent rate of $52, but true to the adage of 'getting what you pay for' a lower-paying guest gets the leavings, and the front desk immediately placed me in a distant lower wing. as i walked the quarter mile through glass skybridges, up elevators, down elevators, through the convoluted maze, i had a strong sense of dMao jBiao  vu... and it was true, i had stayed there before. the wings of this hotel were an afterthought; the 14-story tower building was a huge success, and of course greed made the owners try to expand on something good and ruined a wonderful hotel by adding the wings. to get to them is an alpine trek, dragging luggage down a hall, up an elevator, through the skybridge, down an elevator, up an elevator to the next, etc. on and on. you can drive to them and park outside, so for a family i suppose you could build a case for them. however the big problem is that the rooms in the wings are universally equipped with air conditioning and heating units apparently once the prototype of a jt8d pratt and whitney turbojet engine. low, medium and high fan speeds are exactly the same, a roar that earplugs can't begin to silence. after two rooms i complained so loudly at the desk that the woman staffer upgraded me to the tower, and gave me a $15 discount voucher which i used quite happily on room service. ironically the tower is older but much nicer than the wings.the rooms have been extensively refurbished and have silent air conditioning and comfortable beds. when i went to the ice machine and filled my bucket there was a black spot in the ice, and when i dug through it i found a swollen and frozen dead housefly. i'm glad i didn't fill my glass to make a cold drink, but that has to be a rare thing and i'm not holding it against the doubletree... a fly in the middle of winter in seattle? hmm, maybe it was there since last summer and finally worked it's way to the... oh let's just drop it!about the dMao jBiao  vu, and to risk beating a dead horse, i had stayed there years ago when it was the red lion, had the exact same experience, and vowed never to stay there again. little did i know that doubletree had taken it over, and was not the old doubletree. (you can't win!) they have such a good reputation but to take on properties like this erodes my faith in their name... that time i was there for two weeks and i was stupid enough to put up with the turbine pit for several sleep-deprived days before complaining my way into the tower! lol!it's a huge hotel, reminiscent of a las vegas resort. nice pool, steamy-hot outdoor spa, though the guests coming in through the extensive and far reaching skyway were all shivering and teeth chattering in the near-freezing air. probably a better amenity in the warmer months. they have an outstanding exercise facility, and as far as food the pan-fried hazelnut crusted halibut on fettuccine made it all the way to my room in great condition for a dine-in meal that was excellent. all in all, doubletree has done its best to run this pathetic property, but you you can't teach a pig to sing and you can't make a poorly thought out property work to their standards without major structutural changes by the owners. dollar for dollar it pales in comparison to the nearby hilton, which i had just stayed at for $50 priceline dollars and loved it.

']","good location for early morning flight we spent the night in this hotel our last evening in seattle before an 8 a.m. flight. the area around the airport can be iffy, as in many large metropolitan areas. this hotel is clean, neat and offers good value for the money. we felt safe and secure with our small children. and they have the famous doubletree chocolate chip cookies!we were wiped out from a long day and wanted to stay in the room for the night and rest. we ordered clam chowder from the menu - much better than i expected - and finished off fruit from pike place market. the hotel has seen its newer days: the carpets are threadbare in some spots and the cement balconies are noticeably empty of furniture. but the rooms are a great size, and we noticed large groups of flight attendants from various airlines staying there as well. the hotel employees were very polite and most efficient: we were on our way to our room within 30 seconds, warm cookies in hand. i went down to the lobby about 5:30 a.m. to print out our boarding passes, and a front desk employee came over to be sure everything was going well and i had what i needed - nice touch.

way more hits than misses once you find youself confidently in the proper spot on the third level courtesy curb at sea-tac, which is no small adventure unto itself, just look for the large doubletree bus. there is another downtown doubletree shuttle so make sure you are on the correct shuttle! only a short 8 minute ride put us at the hotel check in for a signature warm cookie and friendly service. i was originally assigned a ground room floor in a remote building but requested a 3rd floor/top floor room instead, preferably overlooking the onsite pond. without a blink from the desk clerk, i got my third floor...only later did i understand it was in the tall tower staring at scaffolding that was part of the exterior stucco project occuring this april and may. i had a view of two busy streets, a parking lot and the large northwest airlines maintenance hangar each morning. despite not being informed of this construction on checkin or during my reservation, the workers were of no consequence and i never heard them. i just had to keep a south window curtain pulled since the scaffolding was right....there. i was here for an intense work session anyhow and it wasn't noisy beyond what i expected for an airport hotel so i bit the bullet and kept the room. i'll get the 3rd floor pond view on another visit. i'm sure i could've pushed but just needed to get settled and get busy.the building layout here is rather adventurous so take care to consider how far you want to be from certain features and/or activities. if you do want a view, the upper floors of the tower offer westward views across seatac and the elliot bay area. despite the ages of the buildings, the lower structures all have a very contemporary northwest feeling to them with exposed beams and rich details throughout the complex. i found this to be very welcoming and comfortable. keep in mind the views are limited if any from this complex.the tower room had a corner wrap around deck but no exterior chairs to enjoy the crisp humid air. i did have a chair out for a few evening hours to enjoy the air. since the deck above partially covered mine, it was like a room extension and the wraparound deck was enormous. without scaffolding and workers there i'm sure it is downright enjoyable.the room itself was large with a mixture of maple and cherry woods with contemporary shapes and accents. upon entering the room, to the left is a full sink and closet, with the bath, toilet and another full sink further left and separated by a door. they have the nice touch of a full length mirror on this door, whcih seems to be a rarity for hotels i been in recently. the closet was generous and had plenty of hangars, an iron and ironing board. a few steps further into the room and it oepned up to the bed, a long couch, end table, coffee table, occassional chair, a full size desk and even an adjustable task chair for the desk area. the king size bed was comfortable and had 6 comfortable feather pillows. the bedside table had a phone along with the standard hilton multi-function alarm clock. doubletree offers a wolfgang puck branded coffee and tea with a special maker for you to use (but you'll have to unplug your computer to do it). the adjacent desk area was comfortable and easy to work on. my only complaint was the single outlet space on the desk shared by the coffee maker. if you have more than three items to charge or want coffee, you'll have to go looking high and low.hvac was electronically controlled and was easily and quickly adjusted. it was a return air system and was only a low hum. ther return air register above the stand alone sink was furrier than a pet shop and definately needed a good vacuum and wipe down.each room is equipped with pay by the day or pay by the hour ethernet internet and i had no problems connecting for service. if you want to save the time or only need it for a short period, the lobby area has reliable wifi for free. i only hooked up one day of my stay and the others i used the lobby wifi for data transfers. using a webservice you can print directly to the front desk and it will be delivered or you can pick it up. this was a huge time saver and no charge for the service. it works from both the pay accounts and the free wifi.decor was toward the tans, oranges, and browns in the room, and that kept a nice feeling depite the typical semi sunny and rainy weather during the stay. the room carpet was well kept with only a few stains near the coffee maker. the bathroom was roomy and clean. i still find it hard to overlook the extensive grout mold that seems to crop up at all price points only because it is not a hard fix, it just takes someone using the right material in a proper install. the complimentary nutragena bath condiments were welcome as i like that they are non-allergenic and don't leave a scent of any sort. the best part of the bathroom was the lack of noise from any other resident or function around you. the room was overall a fairly quiet place but keep in mind you are across from a busy airport and a stones throw from one of the bsuiest intersections in the region. you will hear noise and some of it will be loud enough to notice.the features of the hotel are pretty good. the lobby restaurant is pretty good for all meals and the bar/grill could use better service but didn't get so bad as to not be able to recommend it. there is a little coffee and danish spot as well as a full service sundries shop, just be ready to pay airport prices for your purchases. the bright spots are the well appointed health clubs that serve the tower and complex. among the nicest i've seen in the past few years.the tower room looking west was too low to see anything but high enough not to be insulated from the road and airport noise. i'd go as as high up as possible in the tower to have the view or as far to the northeast as possible to get a room on the pond and some quiet. everything in between will still have something in proximity - you'd do well to look at the hotel layout and talk it over with the reservation or desk clerk to get the room you really want. ill be back, but on that 3rd or 4th floor overlooking the pond next time.

the other room we had been assigned was missing that and the lampshades by the bed side - no lampshades!! besides that, even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room, it truly smelled of smoke in there. then i noticed that the a/c wasn't kicking in even though i was lowering the thermostat into the 50's. called the front desk and explained the situation and that i wasn't happy with the rooms i had been assigned. the person at the front desk was quick in re-assigning us to different rooms at which point we had to pack up our bags and go back all the way to the front desk to pick up the new keys. the second rooms were better, they were cooler and the heavy sun-blocking curtain was there. why these rooms had them and not the others, i don't understand! headed out to take in some sights and we were back at our rooms by 9:30 pm. the a/c system was not cooling the rooms at that point. i was about to call the front desk when the fire alarm went off. grabbed the most important items and joined the rest of the guests in exiting the building. a staff person from the front desk was going around asking guests to return to their rooms and that it had been a false fire alarm. i decided to go to the front desk to complain about the malfunctioning a/c. i can only describe the scene as chaos when i got there. there were many guests just screaming and complaining about the whole situation. there was this lady who had mentioned the alarm had gone off two nights before. another gentleman was demanding to be moved to a different red lion. the front desk was getting calls from the rooms complaining about how warm it was and all they were suggesting was for the guests to open the windows to let some of the cool air in. the poor guy at the front desk looked like he was going to lose it any minute and appeared to be on the verge of tears. i finally made my way to the front desk and asked what was going on with the a/c. he said he just did not know. well, how was he going to handle the situation. he explained that all he could do was call an a/c maintenance guy to look into the situation. i explained i just could not and would not stay at a place without any a/c. he ended up not charging for the rooms for the night and i started to search the internet for another hotel to move to for the rest of my stay. it was a night of tossing and turning because of the warmth. i think at most i got 3 hours of itermittent sleep that night and was just exhausted in the morning. i just could not wait to leave in the morning. red lion hotels are supposed to be at least three stars but this one, because of the state that it is in, i can not even classify it as a motel. if you are considering a stay here, do not do so until you confirm that renovations have been completed. shame on the new owner for not closing the place and completing renovations before opening up for business. i guess the negative reviews will continue on this one throughout the summer season.there might have been some things that i wold have been willing to overlook but the last straw were the problems with the cooling and what seemed might be regular false fire alarms. i can not comment on the breakfast, i did not partake since i just wanted out of there - fast!!

(why don't they water the lawn overnight?)now the good: i found the front desk staff to be very friendly and courteous. each one tried their best to be personable and helpful to my needs. the bed was comfortable and had at least 4 pillows. the lobby had continuous coffee available. i asked for the conference room we were in to have the temperature adjusted, and a maintenance person was there within 15 minutes. the outdoor pool was not heated, but adequate. the lounge chairs were very low, though, and hard to get back out of. considering how close we were to the airport, i didn't hear airplane noise at all.overall, the service by the staff and the comfort of the room made the stay pleasant enough. i wouldn't pick this place for a longer visit, though. if i was to spend any more time in the room, i would want it to have more space to be comfortable. the tv did not have as many channels to choose from.

(it would have been sooner if rooms were available). here is a sample of what some of families experienced:* requested a 1st floor room with two beds due to having an elderly parent and was given a 2nd floor room. after 2 hours of waiting was given a 1st floor room with a king bed. took another 4 hours before their room was available. (no elevators)* a guest called from the airport for pick-up. was told it would be 10 minutes. after waiting an hour they called the hotel and was told to take a taxi. * rooms were unavailable upon check-in because housekeeping had run out of bed sheets. we were given one bath towel for 4 of us to use. * four families in our group were locked out each time the hotel room door closed. maintenance was called (rafael -- we got to know him well) lives 45 minutes away - maintenance is not on site. on several occasions it took several hours because the front desk said they were never told that someone was locked out. once rafael's assistance locked the tool (that is used to open the door) in the room he had just fixed and then was unable to retrieve it because the door wouldn't open with the keycard.* we were standing in line for quarters for the washer (they do not have quarters available at the front desk) and the business travelers in front of us were told that the 3 rooms they had reserved were given away-- sorry, it's not their fault. * the front counter employees are young and are totally lacking in customer service. an employee accused a guest of throwing a keycard at her and threatened to kick her out of the hotel.* one of the father's was solicited by a prostitute at the corner gas station.* a fed-ex package was sent to one of the families that contained his daughter and his passports. he began checking with the front desk at 10:00 a.m. every half hour to see if the package had arrived. finally he went on-line at noon to check the status of the package and michele had sign for the package at 9:52 a.m. he went to the front desk and asked if there was a michele and she said that's me. he said that she signed for the package. she went in the back office and came out with his passports -- the package was opened and their passports were taken out.* it took over 2 hours to check-out due to an incorrect daily charge (yes, we had to pay for this experience). the clerk was unable to correct the amount and asked me to trust them to take care of it tomorrow when the manager was in. yeah, right!! i called the credit card company from the front desk because the clerk didn't know how to reverse the charge. we had been charged 4 different amounts which total to over $1,000 for a $400 bill. the clerk spoke to the credit card company and had the charges reversed and she promised that the manager would adjust the bill the next day to reflect the correct amount and charge our visa. today i checked our visa account and we've been charged $800 for a $400 bill. the nightmare continues...many of the families stayed at the town and country extended stay on interurban avenue in tukwila and said that the staff and management was extremely friendly and made you feel welcome. the accomodations are similar (70's era) but the rooms are big with a refrigerator and stove(it was an apartment conversion). the daily rate was the same. i can honestly say it was a nightmare. don't let the pictures fool you, be sure to read all the negative comments that guests have written about their experience -- we wished we had before reserving at this red lion hotel.

Huo Yu nchained melodyHuo ?haunts us still! lol they did not harass us to join in. we had full cooperation from these hardworking young people, especially when we saw a need to report some unseemly comments. turns out it was mostly a cultural thing, and apologies were accepted.the spa was also an experience worth mentioning Huo ?the masseuses were well-trained and did reflexology, chakra points, lymphatic drainage, shiatsu, deep-tissue, hot stone, and aromatherapy massages among other treatments! the anti-stress 80 minute massage left two of us feeling like we were walking on clouds afterwards.tours having done these other times, we opted to stay beached this year. as usual, other guests returning from excursions waxed poetic about their experiences in saona. a new one this year was freedom adventures to san rafael del yuma . . . reasonably priced! see patricia (she speaks french and spanish) in the jewellery boutique in the lobby for information. ask about lionel (lee-oh-nel) and his excursion. departure and check out we checked the sunquest book the night before and found that we had a delay of three hours in our departure time so we got to see our friends longer than we thought the next morning. when our bus did arrive, we were sad to leave our little community and new friends.conclusion the colony bay resort, its owners, management and staff, deserve kudos for running an operation this smoothly after being rushed to open for the Huo She igh seasonHuo ? two months in, i believe, and the other 5 people in our group concur, they made our stay a pleasure. the fault squarely lies in the promotion being done by the tour companies who have represented the hotel as a 4 1/2 or 5 star. we were appalled to discover that there were such disparities in the prices guests had paid for their one-week all-inclusive stays. we booked in october 2007. some who booked earlier paid much less, some more. imagine our dismay, also. to find that travellers from much farther air distances had paid one-third what we had for the same rooms, same service, same food and drink and the same march break week!!! though we are not litigious in nature, we do plan to approach this company from whom we have had superior service in the past, for compensation.what we loved best about colony bay was its small size Huo ?there were never any lineups anywhere. we actually saw the same people more than once during the week! we met some amazing folks at this small and intimate resort, and they and the staff made this one our best experiences on holiday. all our best wishes to colony bay as it grows and improves! michelle, sandi, leah, jeff, lynn, rick, chris, gino, patricia, audrey, veronica, dan, paige, cameron, hanna, patti . . . and all the others, thanks! where to next year, my friends?

']","beautiful waves yes this is a new hotel. my daughter and i stayed from feb. 25, 2008 until march 3, 2008 and too say the least it was great ,very personal feeling while your there. colony bay is one of the smallest resorts i have ever stayed in (which is 3 times a year ) but by no means is that a bad thing. you can actually remember a lot of names of the people. if you are a person that likes too get a 5 star service and demand nothing but the best this is not for you, and yes i would have to say it is not a five star nor will it ever be. after saying that it will probably be a solid 4 star once the grounds are more mature considering every plant and flower needs time too grow. we arrived very late around 1 am. i really don't think they were expecting us. there seemed too be some confusion but after a quick drink and some pizza at the sports bar it was all figured out quickly and we had our room. 80 % of the people i spoke to knew english enough to actually have a conversation along with other languages. the room was nice and we had no problems with anything the beds were comfortable,tv and phone worked, shower was one of the best ones i have ever had the water pressure was great and so was the temperature. the food was also very good .i am almost ashamed too admit it but we only made it to breakfast on the last day because my daughter and i stayed out most nights dancing the night away witch i will talk about further down.there is 2 buffets nightly 1 is by the lobby it was very good lots too chose from. we mainly went to the buffet closer to the water because it was outdoors and it had a different theme every night. there was one other restaurant the steakhouse but we were told it was no good and i'm not a big fan of dominican beef so we didn't try it. sorry forgot about the pizzeria by the sports bar as well ,everyone seemed to like it. the grounds were kept very clean yes the hot tub by the morning would get dirty but you can't control the wind and sand everyone seemed quick to take pictures when it was dirty but in reality they cleaned it often this is what i mean when i say not for people that expect to go to the dominican and have everything perfect every second of the day. great for people that like to actually go away and enjoy what your there for vacation!!! the beach (not white sand) but still beautiful was very nice to watch you wouldn't let your children go there unattended but very nice and fun to play in the waves once you get in. the pool was a lot of fun the animation crew was the best . they worked very hard to keep the guest entertained witch they did quite well even thinking about it now i still laugh. if your the type that likes to just relax a simple no thank you and they won't bother you again. the shows at night were also quite entertaining again they work very hard to please you and they do!! there is a very nice lobby bar very nice to sit there and relax before and after dinner bar staff very friendly every where on the resort and you never have to wait for a drink. i don't usually write such a long review but i honestly feel this resort was unfairly judged considering it just opened! don't be afraid to go here just remember everything takes time and don't sweat the small things and you won't ruin your vacation by being angry because its not perfect yet!!! i witnessed some people being very rude to the staff when in reality all they had to do was ask and i'm 100% sure any problem they did have would have been dealt with in a timely matter. as for the dancing the night away i mentioned earlier the staff are there to make sure you have fun and if you want to i would recommend the disco/sports bar lots and lots of fun, but if you want to sit and relax maybe not so active you definitely have to go to the bar at the main lobby where daniel and other bar staff will take care of you !

we have been to puerto plata dr, huatulco mx (x3), mayan riviera mx (x2), jamaica, bahamas, panama, along with numerous other non-caribbean destinations. we stayed at this resort from feb 23-mar 1 with 5 other couples. some of the things i will touch on may seem small and you may think i am overly picky. i simply want to give a comprehensive review - sometimes....all the small things add up and negatively affects your vacation.arrival - arrived at 2pm. room not ready but we were fine with this as check-in is not until 3pm. had lunch, came back at 3pm, and room was ready. room key is on a chain with a piece of wood that has the room number engraved on it. very easy to fix...just remove the piece of wood and stash it away until you have to check out.room - quality of workmanship in the room is very poor. caulking and grout work is very poorly done. there is already mildew over the grout in the shower and i'm not sure why as there is a bathroom fan - maybe it's not vented to the outside? accessories like soap dish and toilet paper holder are already rusted. the holes in the walls for the receptacles for wall plugs, thermostat, etc were made too big. walls are very thin. i could hear the man in the next room cough, amongst other things. if it is a very windy night, put a towel against the bottom of the room door or it will bang and rattle. beds are pretty comfortable but the sheets don't fit the bed - they are too short so, by morning, the bottom sheet is pretty much off the bed. there is a small flat screen tv with a variety of channels and the phones in the room now work. there is no clock so you may wish to bring a small travel clock. in spite of all the little things, we were one of the lucky ones. leaking pipes seem to be in a lot of rooms and this problem was not unique to just our group. we heard from many other people that they had water problems. one couple we travelled with had water leaking from the bathroom ceiling almost every day and maintenance could not seem to do a permanent fix. another couple we were there with had to be moved to a different room as the toilet apparently wasn't hooked up properly and backed up all over the room. yet another couple we were with kept having their air conditioning break down.food - average, just okay. there is a lovely pasta bar and i took advantage of this quite frequently. one woman said to me if there wasn't this pasta bar, i'd go hungry. maybe a little over the top but, indeed, the food wasn't great. we've stayed at many riu's, grand sirenis, gala and i would consider their food 5 star and this resort, in comparison, would be a 3 star at best. i will say they do a lovely job on their mexican-themed night. it was very tasty. given the ownership is italian, i would have thought their italian night would be stellar....average only. we did not try out the steakhouse but the rest of our group did. some liked, some did not. alcohol - as advertised, only the domestic alcohol is included (mostly normandy brand). it's not great but the bartenders can mask the taste with some pretty amazing drinks. the sports bar makes the best chunky monkeys! you can buy international booze at $5-7 per shot. staff - the resort's saving grace! from the grounds keepers, to the chefs, to the servers, to the bartenders, to housekeeping, etc. almost every staff member we came in contact with was wonderful. there were smiles all round and they wanted to make our stay a pleasant one. the only exceptions were the sunquest rep (who was replaced by someone else while we were there) and one gentleman at the front desk (see my comments under 'check out').beach - sunquest advertises this as a white sand virgin beach. white sand it is not. it is a beige sand. but it is nice and soft. unless you step on glass. i'm not sure why there is so much glass on this beach unless it is working it's way up through the sand. this would have been a vacant piece of land before the resort was built which probably had a lot of garbage dumped on it (this seems to be the norm in the dr on vacant land). by the end of each day, we had picked up and put into a cup anywhere from 5 to 15 pieces of glass - just in the immediate area around our palapa. it is very windy at this location so the waves are quite strong. we enjoyed body surfing..lot's of fun. if you are not a strong swimmer, be cautious and use your judgement as the flag telling you about water conditions went missing on day 2 and never returned. one young fellow (early 20's), got pulled under by an undertow and was being pulled out to sea - he managed to swim out of it by swimming parallel to the shore. oddly enough, the waves weren't as big on that day as they were on other days.palapas/beach chairs/towels - towel game is alive and well at the colony bay. we don't mind as we are very early risers when we are away and like to be up to watch the sunrise. we were therefore at the beach and choosing our palapa around 6am. my hubby would go with our mugs and get coffee and some pastries and we would watch the show. we watched many people from 6:00am onward put out their towels and leave for hours. the gentleman who is responsible for bringing down the towel cart at 6:30ish can be tipped to save a palapa for you. we had heard this from other guests and indeed we saw this in action. he had an assistant with him first thing and the two of them would wander around putting towels out on beach chairs/palapas around the beach and pool. one day we counted 9 bundles of towels at 5-6 towels per bundle that he put out for guests.pool - nice size. in-pool loungers are lovely. they did have some trouble regulating the chemicals for a few days and the pool was quite murky for 2 days. i think they shocked the heck out of it at that point which is good but, if you have sensitive skin, you may end up with a rash on your skin everywhere your bathing suit touches it (folliculitis). i know i do! i'm sure cortate cream will do the trick.amenities, etc - these are the following things that sunquest and this resort advertises which are not available at this time: sailboats, minigolf, video games room, conference centre. the fitness centre is not air conditioned and there are only three machines, one of which did not work. the casino is made up of about 10 slot machines and one black jack table. i think there is also a hold 'em table but i never saw anyone there.check out - this is where we had our only problem with a staff member. the fellow who checked us out (pm me if you wish to know who), tried to charge us for a long distance phone call that we never made. we kept in contact with our daughter via email (their internet prices are very good) and only used the phone once the whole week to call a couple in another room to give them a wake up call. this fellow became quite rude when i insisted we made no such call. i happened to see the owner in the lobby so i called him over. he said that yes i had made the call but it is no problem and i will not be charged. i very politely explained to him that it is a problem as i had made no such call and suggested he check his phone system.summary - to sum it up, sunquest advertises this resort as a 4 1/2 star and the resort gives itself a 5 star. i don't believe this resort will ever be more than a 4 star at best. they would have to tear the place down and start over to improve upon the poor workmanship. we stayed at the grand sirenis in the mayan riviera shortly after it opened last year and it has 1700 rooms per side. the workmanship there was far better.if anyone launching the complaint or suit against sunquest is reading this, please personal message me and i will give you my email as i definitely feel we should get a partial refund or travel vouchers for a future trip somewhere else. a month before we were there, this resort showed as fully booked. we met 3 couples there who live in our area that booked it only 2 weeks before they arrived and they paid $500 per person less than we did. we were told this is because many people pulled out due to bad reviews and sunquest tried to sell it cheap just to fill the rooms.i'm sorry about being so long-winded but i felt very strongly about making this review as comprehensive as possible.

( we've stayed at a lot of hotels near the sea tac airport, and i think that we've finally found a good one that meets our needs.) dozens of flights in and out of the airport had been canceled because of a snowstorm. three feet of snow had fallen at our home in spokane and the city was coping, but three inches of snow in seattle and the city grinds to a complete halt! the shuttle easily took us from the airport the short distance to the hotel. our check in was perfect without any problems, which was a little surprising considering the long long of guests waiting at the counter. because of the storm, many employees had been held over at the hotel and not gone home. dozens had worked back to back shifts and many had stayed overnight themselves. (when it snows in seattle, the city stops suddenly and transportation is very difficult.) the front desk staff could have been cranky but they weren't. i could tell they were tired, but they all seemed to pull together to help out. that's a good sign in the hotel industry. i came in contact with quite a few hotel staff members and they all seemed to want to pitch in and help to get through the crisis. i saw more smiles than frowns. we had connecting king rooms 2105 and 2107 on the ground floor across the hall from several conference and meeting rooms. ($119 plus tax) they were big and comfortable. everything worked. the bathrooms were a bit small and, for some reason, the toilets were angled diagonally out from the corner of the bathroom, but everything was neat and clean. the business center's two computers and two printers worked. there is a spencer's steak restaurant in the lobby, and while the food was pretty good it was unusually expensive and the service was unbearably slow. i'll give the restaurant staff some credit for dealing with the bad weather and i'm guessing that a lot of employees weren't able to show up for work, but dinner for four took two hours and cost $250. the waiters all seemed to ignore us, as did the receptionist and the manager. that could have been a better experience and the restaurant itself is not a self-contained unit, it's in a corner of the lobby and during our stay it was extremely cold and drafty. our nights were peaceful and room service breakfast arrived precisely at the time we had ordered it, which is a very good thing! the fan/air conditioning/heating system in our room seemed extremely noisy. it would have been nicer if it was quieter. even though there's an outdoor pool on site, it would have been nice if a facility this big had an indoor pool as well. but you can't have everything! this hotel is close to the airport, clean and comfortable with a good restaurant in house. there's a lot to like here. we'll be back.

accomodations were very good and the staff (with one exception) was excellent. an on-demand free shuttle to and from the airport is another highlight. the hotel is almost across the street from the airport. it can be a little noisy but that's to be expected at an airport hotel. i would caution anyone who has never landed at sea-tac airport that the courtesy shuttles are all in the parking garage. it is necessary to take a skywalk and an elevator to the shuttle area. if you have a lot of baggage definitely rent a cart in the baggage claim area. on my first stay, the shuttle driver was very attentive and friendly and offerred to take my bags up to my room upon check-in. the shuttle drivers take turns and also serve as bellhops. this was very welcome to me because i have been recovering from surgery. however, on my second stay, i did not receive as nice a welcome either from the shuttle driver or the front desk staff. i did arrive around 1030pm and there were other guests checking in at the same time. when i did arrive at the check-in desk, the clerk was apologetic for my wait for the shuttle. this kind of puzzled me because i didn't have much of a wait. it turns out that he thought i was someone else. i was never asked if i needed help to my room. i know i should have asked for assistance but did not which was not good for me physically. it just didn't seem like there was anyone available. since i am a hilton honors member, i was given an option with my reservation confirmation to order something light through room service in advance. i did so. i inquired about this at the front desk. without checking at all, the same front desk clerk said that it is the room. this was not the case. it was delivered to me fairly promptly. i do not fault the food service department because i actually arrived earlier than anticipated. however, i felt that the clerk just couldn't be bothered to check. i also called down to the front desk about a problem with one of the room phones in that the speed dials to the desk did not work. the same clerk who had helped me previously answered the phone. he was neither helpful about this situation or very helpful regarding my quesitons about the hotel's business center. i believe that this was most likely a training issue with this individual employee and the not overall service orientaiton for the hotel. all of my other encounters with hotel employees were very postiive. speaking of food, the hotel restaurant, spencers is first class. i am familiar with this restaurant since there is also a spencers at the doubletree in spokane. this is not an inexpensive restaurant but the steaks are first class. the restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner. i did have breakfast in the restaurant the second time i stayed there. they had a very extensive breakfast buffet for $17. it was excellent. i'm not sure if they offer this buffet every morning.i would definitely stay at this hotel again for similar circumstances. i fly out of seattle a lot to go to other parts of the country. it is very convenient to break up the trip. personally, i probably would not stay here if i was spending any length of

at least, i was until i read some of the earlier reviews on trip advisor. it seemed like everybody was intent on pointing out all of the difficulties of staying at a brand new resort. however, since spending my birthday week in dr at a resort with the most beautiful ocean property, lush accomodations, and friendliest staff i have ever seen, i have simply come to the conclusion that some people aren't happy unless they're unhappy (you know the ones i mean - they always can find something to complain about!). i wanted a chance to set the record straight.first off, i wasn't kidding when i said that the elegance is set on the most beautiful beach i have ever seen. one day my husband and i went for a walk down the beach for an hour and a half one way, and as far as we could see, the white sandy beach had no end. it was always fairly windy, but that was pleasant because it kept us cool and comfortable. the water was generally wavy, but that made it more fun to bob the waves and body or boogie surf. as well, i had brought mosquito spray having heard about troublesome mosquitos, but honestly i only saw one mosquito during our entire week there.we stayed in a standard room with a king size bed and a pool view. our room was amazing - it was the size of two normal hotel rooms made into one. all of the fixtures were funky and fun, and the only complaint i could make is that the toilets were extremely loud when flushed (i'm a light sleeper). and finally i found a resort with a truly comfortable bed. the sheets were new and crisp, and the towels were soft and fluffy (whenever my husband dried his face, he was covered with yellow towel fluff). ah, new linens...there are five a la carte restaurants. our favorites were the steak house (chateau briand - wow!) and the italian. the buffets had a great selection and one week was not enough for us to get bored of the menus. but the real jewel of this resort is the staff. we found so many of the staff bent over backwards to make sure that we were having a fabulous time. in the restaurants and at the bars, cleanliness was meticulous. drinks were refilled often before you asked. our housekeeper seemed to straighten up after us about four times a day (it was very cute, because she would arrange the bed covers slightly different every time she came into our room most likely so we would know that she had been there). one word of note - many of the staff are new to resort employment and are struggling to learn english. although they will flawlessly ask, how are you?, they may not have any english beyond that. instead of speaking slowly and loudly (this does not make them understand you), try to keep your responses or questions simple. perhaps you can even help them learn a new word, because they are eager to communicate. i found smiling worked well :) i also need to mention the evening shows. they are breathtaking, and i was in awe of the performace skills of the entertainers. some shows were a little hokey, like the mr. magistic competition (a contest of humiliation, but still entertaining). my favorite show by far was the michael jackson show. or wait until you see madonna doing vogue at the music revue. the performers are incredibly athletic and talented - their dance abilities are incredible. they'll dazzle you with breakdancing like you've never seen before and seem to enjoy showing off their athletic abilities. all in all, this was the most beautiful and wonderful resort we've ever stayed at. there are a few new resort hiccups, but i found that they didn't seem to affect us. when our tv (big screen plasma by the way!) wasn't working, we phoned the front desk. an hour later we phoned again and after apologizing profusely they sent someone up who promptly fixed it for us. the landscaping is new, and although it hasn't filled in yet, it will be stunning as it continues to grow. about half of the guest rooms were finished (resort was at half capacity when we were there) and the rest seemed to be near the completion and setup stages, but we never heard any construction noise.it is useful to change your canadian money into american money before you leave home. although tips are unneccessary at this resort, i still brought a small stack of u.s. $1 bills and tried to show my appreciation to the staff. to me it's just a buck, but in their world it's a more substantial amount.my favorite things: the majestic drink (try it!), the lobby bar before dinner (we met so many interesting people from around the world - literally!), the evening entertainment shows (michael jackson was the best!), walking along the beach, boogie boarding, all of the staff members, our new friends from charleswood (if you're reading this then you know who you are!), the fitness gym, all of the neat ways our housekeeper made our bed four times a day (even if we hadn't used it)my less than favorite things: the appetizer at the french restaurant, the first 15 minutes in our room at the end of the day until the air conditioner got some of the humidity under control (all room power is on a motion sensor and it gets pretty warm when you 've been out for the hottest part of the day), speedo type g-string bikinis on mature men, having to come back home to winterso to sum it up, you can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of the people some of the time, and there are some people who will never be pleased unless they can find something to be displeased about. i was pleased all of the time, and i hope to return to this resort and see how it matures.

(extra cost for the good stuff but worth it). go to breakfast early - the good types of fruit tends to run out by mid-morning - or ask for what you want  they will get it for you. the bar up top on the main lobby makes the best capuccinos. pitfalls - this is a brand new hotel so there will be hiccups here and there. ask to be moved if you are not happy with what you get. also, the foliage needs a few months to grow up. overall, we felt we had a wonderful vacation and are planning to come back. we would recommend this to our friends. get the club elegance package!

3519,1.0,['the lobby bar and piano bar are beautiful and elegant.'],"don't stay here this is my third day at the resort and i wanted to write my thoughts about what's going on. check in was easy. we were greeted with cold towels and a nice fruit drink. so far, so good. that's when the problems started. although we requested a room with two double beds, when we arrived at the room, there was only one bed. the bellboy called the front desk while we waited outside the room for fifteen minutes. we dragged our carry on luggage back to the front desk (which was quite a hike since the property is quite large) while one of the manager apologized for the mixup and handed another set of room keys. unfortunately the second room that we went to was occupied (oops, that was quite a screw up). the third room was ok, although it had some issues (which i'll discuss later).pros: the bar and restaurant staff is great. they jump over backwards to take care of you. slip them a few bucks and they'll remember you and take care of you. no one seems to tip here, but a little money goes a long way. they're hard working folks and do the their best to take care of you. the grounds are beautiful and they're always maintenance people cleaning. the pool is nice and big although you've got to be crazy to swim in it because the water's sub-zero. the lobby bar and piano bar are beautiful and elegant. the beach is pretty.cons: i don't know where to start, but to sum it up, they never should've opened so early. half the rooms aren't finished and there is construction all over the place. our room, in particular has many problems. when you take a shower, the toilet (which is adjacent to the shower) floods halfway through the bathroom area. the floors are made of marble and an inch of water on the floor can be quite nasty and unsafe. the tv is on the desk (not mounted to the wall as it should be), there are several open electrical outlets, there is no outside handle to the patio door, the room is halfway painted, the a/c doesn't work half the time. the food is terrible (please don't go to the french restaurant) and i think i will be losing weight on this trip (which may not be a bad thing but considering you paid a premium amount of $$ for a vacation it would be nice to eat well). the elevator was broken for two days. they clean the room really late in the day (after 6, which i think is completely unacceptable). today i called housekeeping for extra towels three times (which i need to mop up the flooding floor). by 11:30 p.m., there were no towels, so i dragged myself up to front desk and yelled at them. i waited a half an hour at the desk until they brought them to me. they pump seriously annoying music through a sound system that runs through the entire property (mostly by the pool area). drowning it out with a ipod is the only answer or else you will go nuts. the beach is narrow and crowded.i have spoke to several people that i've met and most of them have had problems, some worse and some better. my advice to anyone considering staying at this hotel....don't. they might work out the kinks in the next 6-9 months or so. then it will be a fabulous hotel. management cannot cope with all the problems. worse, they just don't care. they never would consider comping your for anything, refunding your money or apologizing for what's going on. if i could, would leave right now. it's that bad. save your hard earned money and go somewhere else and don't make the mistake i did.

but after one, it doesn't matter so much anymore) and a fruit plate waiting for us. upon first walkthrough, i immediately noticed a few craftsmanship issues: one light fixture was crooked, like a level hadnHuo Zhua  been used to put it up, there was recessed lighting in a nook above each bed and there was a spot where a hole had been cut and then they figured out it was wrong and they cut another hole for the light Huo ?the first hole was poorly patched and painted over, the marble (Huo Ming sh?) shower looked wonderful (and was Huo ?4 different water outputs which was very relaxing), but some of the faucet fixtures had holes a bit larger than the fixture (it appeared they didnHuo Zhua  have the right tools to accurately cut and fit holes for them? so that was a little unappealing cosmetically), the showers did leak into the toilet area (but not into our room and it wasn't an overwhelming leak), our tv wasnHuo Zhua  on the wall (which wasnHuo Zhua  a concern at all) but it didnHuo Zhua  work and our ceiling fan didnHuo Zhua  work. we called about the ceiling fan and the tv and a repair guy showed up in less than a minute. he was able to fix both. the only other issue with the rooms was that our a/c didnHuo Zhua  seem to work as well as others in our group, but it was adequate and we did have a sewage smell/fresh drywall (yeah, if you can imagine that?) that was quite overwhelming upon first walking into the room, but we got used to it quickly, so it couldnHuo Zhua  have been that bad. it was much worse our last day there, so we werenHuo Zhua  sure if it was an issue of more people starting to check in and straining the plumbing or not? this smell was not an issue in the other 2 rooms our group had. although these cosmetic issues aren't impacting on my fun, i do think if they're aren't reviewed and fixed, it will affect people's overall perspective on this resort eventually. in the beginning, they can be overlooked, but they shouldn't still exist in an established 4 star (5?) resort.some in our group had maid/turn down service 2-3x a day with the maids making the beds if theyHuo Zui  been in for a nap, but we only had maid service 2x in 5 days. they have sensors outside the rooms that tell the employees when the room is occupied so they know when they can enter and one of our roommates slept at odd hours, so that might explain the sporadic maid service. the swim-up rooms are nice and will be nice when the landscaping is better. the ground outside our room was lumpy and the shrubs separating us from our neighbors are baby shrubs and not exactly effective. it wasnHuo Zhua  exactly a Huo Gan ardenHuo ? but if the Huo Yuan ardens' outside the majestic colonialHuo Chu  equivalent rooms are any indication, this will eventually be a very nice amenity of these rooms. restaurantsjapanese Huo ?we sat at one of the teppan-yaki grills. they serve chicken, beef, shrimp, fried rice and vegetables. not as good as some of the ones iHuo Ji e been to, but it was good for an ai. italian Huo ?in our group we covered most of the menu selections. everyone was happy with their main selections. their caesar salad was made with real anchovies, which iHuo Hui  not used to, but it was ok and the chicken on it was a little dried out and tough. see/sea Huo ?the buffet by the beach during the day, seafood restaurant at night. i had the continental breakfast here once (so-so), and i ate lunch here daily. good variety, but my favorite was probably the pasta station. this is converted to a sit down seafood restaurant in the evening. two of our group tried it one night and they werenHuo Zhua  impressed, but once again, this could be hit/miss. steakhouse Huo ?i didnHuo Zhua  go to, but my group did. they were disappointed. they said the food wasnHuo Zhua  that good and the portions were too small. to present the other side of this, we did talk to other people whoHuo Zui  eaten there and they liked the restaurant a lot, so it sounded like it was hit/miss. gourmet (didnHuo Zhua  try)flavours Huo ?the buffet for breakfast/lunch/dinner near the lobby. similar to the lunch buffet. i only ate breakfast here once. it wasnHuo Zhua  great, but it was suitable. iHuo Ji e had better at aiHuo Chu . it had the right stuff to be a good breakfast buffet, so hopefully it will improve. i never ate there for lunch, but the dinner buffet was decent. as with any buffet, some of it is great, some is not so great. i particularly liked the pizza, pasta and lasagna. iHuo Hui  of the mindset that you donHuo Zhua  go to an ai for food quality and this was sufficient enough that iHuo Hui  on a Huo Qian ost vacation dietHuo ?

sunwing had told us that this hotel had been taking guests since october. we were dropped off at the colonial by the sunwing bus operator, who was then forced to load us back up and take us to the elegance.the lobby and lower bar area was/is magnificent, even with the unfinished drywall and construction debris. the poor check-in men looked as if the computers had just been switched on and that they did not yet know what to do with the computers or with us. first issue-sunwingHuo Chu  description of our room did not match any description of any rooms that the elegance had to offer. ricardo swung into action and sent us to the elegance club check-in area, with the promise that calix would look after us. after a long trip through the construction site, past workers, tools, barrows, wires, etc, i asked the bellboy to stay with our luggage- thinking we may need to get out of there. inside the elegance check-in area calix and his staff were doing everything they could to get their guests comfortable and then moved into rooms that the construction workers had not yet moved out of. the torrential rain caused flooding of the check-in area floor and water was dripping out of numerous areas in the plaster ceiling. the air conditioning was not working, and there were no restaurants open, so we waited. after 2 hours we were taken to the room by calix, the bellboy had stayed (great staff), and upon informing him that this room still did not match the sunwing description, he told us he would get us moved again, we waited in the room for another 2 hours, not having a key to the room, no tv, no drinks in the fridge, no hot water, no telephone, no internet, no ac- lots of construction noise. 2 hrs passed Huo ?i went and found calix- talking on 2 phones at the same time, with the walkie talkie on his belt, standing by the pool watching the men cutting the marble for the overflow drain to be installed. he told me we would have to stay in the room over night- that there were no more rooms available.we went for supper at the italian resturant- i have to say the staff is tremendous- but the meal was late and cold- it took us 2 hours to eat.the first issue continued into the next day- still no other room available, with calix promising to find us one sometime in the futureHuo ?finally after lunch i told him to forget it i would settle this room issue with sunwing. the room we had was nice, i liked the sunken area and the layout. it was on the south side of the resort facing the vacant lot, and was very private with a view of the ocean and the wreck off the coast.second issue-lack of hot water Huo ?we had cold water on the 21st, tepid water on the 22nd, hot water on the 23rd , 24th, 25th, back to cold on the 26th, tepid on the 27th, and hot on the 28th. at least twice during our stay the toilet was hooked to hot water, and on at least 4 separate times the water would be shut off for a period of time.third issue Huo ?electricity Huo ?the power could go off at any time during the day for any length of time with no warning. this happened at least 2 times a day, each day, every day.fourth issue- construction workers and construction noise throughout the entire week. construction workers and bikini clad women donHuo Zhua  mix well (no offense to us construction workers). the noise was continuous throughout the day. they were still building the marble countertops for the pool bar in the elegance club area, and the grinders are quite noisy. as well as hammer drills, hammers, etc as the electricians did their thing.fifth issue- lack of lighting- the walkways in the central garden and pool area did not have the lighting completed until the 26th, (it does look quite spectacular now even with the immature vegetation, to stand at the top of the stairs in the main lobby at night, and look out through the arches towards the ocean is spectacular). the lack of lighting in the corridors still was not addressed by the time we left nov 28th. this meant that as you walked to your rooms you moved from lit corridors into dark areas, this happened on both sides of the complex. the hotel provided security men with nightsticks to stand in these darkened areas.sixth issue Huo ?restaurants Huo ?we really enjoyed eating at this hotel. simply because of the people who were serving us. for the most part they were extremely cheerful and always did their best to help us. however the restaurants were not all open at the same time, and even if they were open, all menu items were not available. the italian restaurant experience on our first day kept us out of it until, the 26th for supper- it was very nice and hot. the steakhouse or as we affectionately called it Huo ?Huo Shi he rodenthouseHuo ? (we were there when the rat dropped out of the ceiling on the large table)- was great. we ate there 4 of the nights we were there. each night the service and the meals got better. the corn and chicken soup was tremendous. the beach house was dark at night for eating. they had not yet got all the lights working and it was ok food but not great. we ate lunch usually at the buffet in the colonial which brings us to the seventh issue.seventh issue- access to the colonial- ricardo and calix and our sunwing rep jenner all told us to go to the colonial and that we were free to use their services. the first 2 days of our trip, no one had told the colonial that and we were hassled, especially regarding internet access. the last 3 days we had to take a long walk detour, through a darkened area and on part of the service road.eighth issue- life safety- no fire extinguishers, no pressure at the fire hose cabinets and intermittent hydro and water left me feeling unsafe.ninth issue- our room really was not ready. the tv was hooked up on our 3rd, but was not hung from the wall on the bracket. the room sensors are a good idea but were not operational, and as a result staff would walk in on you after knocking. the pass thru service system, is another good idea but not yet working. there was no literature, no info of any kind in the room. no dvd player, no dvds either, the library was empty. the ceiling in the shower fell down unto the floor that last morning we were there. it just wasnHuo Zhua  ready yet for guests. the butler system, maid service, bar service all will be great, but arenHuo Zhua  there yet.overall, we had a good time. we met new people- shared the adventure together. got sun, swam in the ocean enjoyed the beach and the people.being a novice to package trips, how sunwing could sell packages to a hotel without any pre inspection is beyond my comprehension.
